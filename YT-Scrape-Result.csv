That's a major potentially confounding factor, because it would be wrong to conclude that they were having insomnia BECAUSE they used marijuana when in fact the converse was true: they were using marijuana BECAUSE they had insomnia.

@rulito12301,"well yes and no. I have been smoking for arround 30 years, it did help for TBI accident I had. Marihuana is not healthy unless you use it for medical purpuses. On those 30 years it has helped me with my fears and recover of the TBI, although I have never had a dream in 30 years. Quiting a few months ago I started dreaming again. Also, smoking regularly damadged my cognitive and memory capacity, leaving me with memory problems I cant recover. I cant even get concentrated on a conversation, and I dont use other substances or drugs. Lastly, smoking marihuana before age 25 causes brain damadge, this has been proven already. So, yes, use it for medical purpuses but no, not for recreational use, it is adictive and very hard to quit. Thanks for the video",0,2024-05-17T22:10:57Z,0

@drew-shourd,"Decent video, much was left incomplete imo. Btw, I smoke every day, all day, have for 44 years (how old are you?...hehehe) I live down here in Michigan, where we can have 12 plants, so I am very well versed on growing and harvesting cannabis. Plus I am well experienced on seed varieties, levels of THC, percentage of either sativa or indica, or even rudaralis if they are auto-flowers. When I lived in Los Angeles (1985-2013)  I started an edible company, Wake and Bake Foods and was mostly making teas and chewy (and healthy) granola bars. I am also very aware that the same type and level of THC (and CBD) can affect the same person differently, on a daily basis, for one reason, what kind and how much food is in their stomach....and that's just one variable out of dozens. So all these medical studies hold some credence for me, although most are done by people who don't partake or really understand it, except possibly molecularly and biochemically. 
And personally, I have and remember amazingly detailed dreams ON cannabis, so much for that study aye?

I've had these chronic problems for a long time now I couldn't walk for a block or cross the street easily by myself.  I have taken several pain medications but the pain lingers.
In 2020, when Cannabis was legalized in Chicago, my son suggested I try it.  I was hesitant of course because of the bad publicity of Marijuana.  I tried smoking it at first, but it made me dizzy and nauseous.  So then I started taking it as ""tea"".  My son makes a concoction of Canna-butter and I would take about 10 ml. of the cannabutter, dissolve it in a hot cup of tea, then drink it before bedtime.
Since then, my mobility has improved dramatically and I could sleep peacefully and longer too.  I've been using ""Cannabis Indica"" (not Sativa) since 2020 up to the present and I don't feel any untoward effects.  I can walk five blocks now, take public transport, sleep soundly at night, no hallucinations or depression (I also take Vit.D3 2000 units to prevent depression since I don't get as much sunlight anymore).  I feel great is all I can say.

So Just don't look at the Terpene profile or the biochemistry of this medical herbal  plant that has two Genders.This Plant so similar to Humans  Hemp makes Pollen Sperm Male. Marijuana Makes Seeds and large Fruit smell good from far away like a female. Each Plant has a different terpene profile for medical uses. Caryaphyllene is anti inflammatory.  Myrcene is a Muscle relaxer. Limonene is anti anxiety. Every flower has different % of terpene because it is bio-chemistry it might work for other stuff. Not all is the same. that is prejudice against weed.,0,2024-05-08T14:47:41Z,0

@joshuaweisel2998,THC stopped my night terrors. I believe we should use it like a medicine because the symptoms you named other sleep meds also effect or make it so people who are sensitive cannot function the next day. THC is an amazing alternative to lots of things but I think it should also be paired with CBD and other cannabinoids and used respectfully as a medical drug if you are looking for the health benefits. They are there just like vitamins you cannot take to much of one. The weed industry today has created strains that are vary high in THC and we should remember that thc is amazing but it is not a fix all drug and is not the only drug cannabis has to offer.,1,2024-05-08T03:36:20Z,0

In other respects however it allowed me to be more ready in the morning since it prolonged my very short sleep cycle, which is short even by short sleeper standards.
We talk 3-5 hours when sober with three making me just slightly tired, which usually got fixed with a ""Garfield style"" coffee in the morning and 5 making me extremely tired to the point of sometimes calling in sick for the day (as strange as it may sound sleeping over 6 hours when clean and off never helped and in general I always felt like a zombie in the morning). Weed improved this insomnia-like state by adding hour or two while eliminating the tiredness almost completely. It also greatly helped with other issues such as my tendency towards anger outbursts (even when not high), voracious hunger, restlessness, depressions, ...and so on.

In all cases part of the problem is sleep stage intrusion, in this case REM cycles intruding on the wake state. Often the drug of choice for such projects are good old anti-depressants.  If you take SSRI's I can absolutely assure you that your REM is delayed and reduced.  I've seen it thousands of times.   ""Taking the rapid out of REM"" is known as SREM in the business (slow REM), but most people refer to it as 'Prozac eyes'.  REM abundance after the cessation of the REM suppressant is known as ""REM Rebound"" and can be quite pronounced.

There is a condition called Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome (CHS) which some pot smokers get who have been smoking for a long time.  As a 68 year old this was unacceptable for obvious reasons.  I should also mention that pot was not as enjoyable as it used to be.  I believe that the reason for this is that the ""manufactured"" pot you get today is not as good as ""good"" pot used to be when I was a teenager although the THC is higher.  Of course this is only a theory.  The point being is that it wasn't hard for me to quit.  My bad symptoms quickly went away and I do feel somewhat more focused also.

@serealfurst,There is a recent metanalysis of studies regarding Cannabinoids and how each one effects sleep and while its been known for a long time that THC affects REM sleep there is now evidence to suggest that CBD in combination with THC effects not only REM but also N3 (deep) sleep. Deep sleep is the stage in which a lot of the muscle repair and physical rejuvenation occurs. More evidence is needed on the effects of CBD regarding sleep but we can extrapolate from this data that adding CBD to an already altered THC sleeping pattern may actually worsen instead of improve it. I think this is important to mention because many daily THC users I know turn to adding CBD on top of their habit (to alleviate negative side effects such as sleep issues or anxiety) instead of taking a break from their usage. It seems to help some people at first but most people I see go through it (myself included) end up with noticeably worse sleep in the long run. I'm off both Weed and CBD now and although the first month was hell I'm sleeping MUCH better now.,0,2024-04-20T13:09:26Z,0

@ItsASuckyName,"For anyone thinking about smoking weed: I was stuck in a bubble and pushed away anyone who even made the slightest comment about me smoking weed. I had no idea I was such a pain to be around and that it had changed my behavior. There was no way for anyone to get me out of it, because I could not see that I was stuck. The only way was to ride it out until it went completely wrong. Losing my friends was the least of my problems compared to the mental health issues weed caused me, and I still have to deal with that 11 years later. It is always good to share the personal downsides of drugs, because the people who say that it is nothing but positive, will scream the loudest and ignore the people spiraling out of control in the process. It is such a big risk for undiagnosed people...which can be anyone. Sure it can have positive effects for certain people, but don't gamble on it. If you or any direct family have mental health issues, than don't just start doing drugs. Take this from someone with schizophrenia and other psychosis related problems triggered because of weed.",1,2024-04-17T07:51:42Z,0

@DarkGodSeti,"I smoke weed regularly or chronically due to the stat you posted (on/off good to have breaks like you said.) and have multiple dreams every night, vivid ones.  I can even influence them by what I watch, games I play, etc. Though, can never do it purposely... ugh...  Zombie apocalypse is not as fun as it sounds...  Only had Dragonball Z powers in like 2-3 dream total... ugh... mostly I have flight or at least levitation (and everyone acts like it normal).  And PROTIP:  Punches don't work in dreams, but!  Headbutts very much do!   
Don't I have a hard time sleeping or staying asleep, sure I wake up sometimes due to having a dry mouth (fan blowing on my face...) or being too hot (weighted blanket is too warm at times...),or cold (I like leaving the bedroom window wide open, even during the winter).  Even before weed, I've always slept an average of 6 hours,  some people need 8 or 9,

@vladimir.rrrrrr,"What helped was finding a balance with the quantities. For example, I smoke almost every evening after 8PM after I've done everything I need to unwind from the day. What worked for me is to use just a little. I don't burn more than 0.3 grams of green every 3-part smoking session. 

It doesn't affect my sleep, I wake up fresh every morning, and haven't noticed any other side effects. It is obviously very important to have your tolerance adapted in order for this to work, so a break for a month (depending on how much you consume) should do the trick. 

I love weed too much not to use it, but I have a life to live and a family to raise, so we need to get our priorities straight. I hope this helps somebody do the same! It works wonders.",0,2024-04-12T23:08:41Z,0

So the people who sell patented drugs are clearly producing videos like this because they are seeking to marginalize the plant, the one that you don't have to pay anyone for if it is grown at home, all so you can help criminals sell patented drugs like Marinol, Buspar, and Ambien.

This is criminal racketeering and the makers of this video should go to jail for this.

May God forgive you and open your eyes, you sinister liars who do not love people enough, you blind bandits who do not know that you are serving Satan when you lie, as Satan wants us to pay more for medicine and for us to suffer. The Satan knows that cannabis is exceedingly medicinal and very fun to use, when it is used correctly and in a careful and thoughtful manner.

@markgriskey,"I suffer from insomnia and other debilitating sleep issues that have plagued me my whole life. My mother actually sent me to afternoon preschool because my circadian rhythm was so severely delayed. School sucked. I never adjusted. Then in my fist year of college I took all night classes, and suddenly became a straight A student. I would normally sleep from 3 am to about noon and felt great. But the rest of the world doesn‚Äôt work that way. Then as I got older, things got worse I could no longer sleep in and my sleep was very fragmented ( wake up after 3 hours then twiddle my thumbs for a couple hours then sleep another 3 hours) then medical pot became legal in CA, and it was like a miracle cure. Would imbibe in the evening and had gummies or vape available if I woke up in the middle of the night. I would get 8 hours of sleep! But yes, my rem sleep was impacted. It was still better to get enough sleep instead of the horrible insomnia/ fragmented sleep. But then! I devolved a horrible condition called CHS. Look it up. It sucks! So I had to give up cannabis and now I‚Äôm a wreck. The rebound effect was awful and now I‚Äôm taking prescription sleep meds as well as anything over the counter I can find (melatonin/ valerian root etc) unfortunately these meds can also effect sleep quality and I don‚Äôt get enough (5 to six hours of fragmented sleep) many doctors are unsympathetic and I am really struggling. Anyway I enjoyed your article. Please check out CHS ‚ÄúCannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome‚Äù and do a video about that condition, it‚Äôs apparently related to your genetic makeup, and many chronic users will never develop it, but ‚Äúlucky me‚Äù I am basically unable to use cannabis long term. I‚Äôm suspecting my insomnia has a genetic root and am hoping to find the magic combination of supplements that will get me back on track (and yes, I eat a healthy diet, get regular exercise, avoid caffeine late in the day etc) it‚Äôs a real bummer that I can‚Äôt use pot for sleep anymore.",1,2024-03-29T16:00:43Z,0

Aside from enjoying the effects, I slept for the first time in almost 2 days.

I realized that when I smoked a lot of weed, sleep would be less resting, but when I limited myself, I could still get some good REM .  A lot of what was causing my insomnia was that my dreams are way too vivid.  Which means when I have a bad dream, it's hyper realistic.

@blacktepes,"I'm gonna tell you on a couple things I discovered:

High psychedelic strains will make you trip if you just smoke and go to bed. It will make you feel suffocated cause your lungs expanded (bronchodillator properties of cannabis) and verticality is not really good when you have expanded lungs. It will feel difficult to breath. The lack of oxygen will also make you trip. Turn to the side to not strain your respiratory system. That usually fixes it.


The overactive or hyper active effects of cannabinoids can also mess with your regular sleep cycles.

@kddicks5115,"The CBD or THC on its own aren‚Äôt as effective. There needs to be a balanced ratio (which I can‚Äôt remember at the moment‚Ä¶must be the weed üòÆ). When this balance is met, then marijuana has more benefits. I‚Äôm a smoker for 35 years and it has always been helpful with sleep and also motivation during the day. The type of weed you smoke matters. Indicas will be more relaxing, sativas are more activating‚Ä¶give some more energy. I smoke Indica consistently. I prefer CBD with the THC, but most are bred now with no CBD. Using them separately does not produce the same results.

@retrovideogamedad8653,"The amount of drugs are prescribed my wife to help with her PSTD, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and just downright the amount of pain. She was physically ill. A lot of childhood trauma that can‚Äôt really easily be resolved. I watched her become sickly, losing her hair sunken eyes. When I asked her what was going on, she showed me a list of bottles that were prescribed to her, by all the psychiatrists. One day a friend offered her a joint and she took it before I realize that she was in the house cleaning making dinner and even started beginning to go back to her hobbies. I noticed at night time she stopped waking up, screaming completely from her nightmares. She wasn‚Äôt as covered in sweat, and she didn‚Äôt cry yourself to sleep some nights, even if she doesn‚Äôt think that I know about them, and this was even with all the medication that was supposed to help her. She looked like a shell of what I fell in love with. I encouraged her to continue using THC and C BD. We all saw the changes, including herself. She said that she was able to sleep better. Her dreams weren‚Äôt as strong. she wake up in the morning and go out into the garden. She began being happy and dancing so I can say it does make a change in some peoples lives.

@georgiewatson8688,"It has never worked for me to help with sleep. All it does is make my nerves extra sensitive and therefore i have some great orgasms after smoking weed but if i'm in any pain it makes it feel sooooo much worse. But then maybe it has something to do with the fact that caffeine doesn't have an effect on me either, managed to give myself type 2 diabetes by drinking 9-12 cans of red bull every day but i still slept 8 hours every night. Also sleeping tablets have never worked for me, both prescription and herbal but anti-anxiety like Lorazapam works perfectly to help me get back to 8 hours a night but they won't prescribe it to me anymore. I was taking 4mg a night for a week and it would kick me back into the 8 hour a night cycle.

@chozen_juan,"This is spot on with my experience. Ive been a smoker for 20yrs or so and when I smoke too much or too often it has negative effects. Everything from foggy mind to irritability. I still vape a bit but way less and I find it much more enjoyable this way. Also if you end up quitting after smoking for a lot or for a long time, expect to have some crazy vivid dreams and some troubles falling asleep for a bit. However, it will pass and your sleep will return to normal. If you do choose to smoke, make sure you're not abusing it. Discipline and moderation are key. If you find that you have to constantly smoke when you have it, then definitely steer away from that shit. Some people spend their whole lives just learning that one lesson.",1,2024-03-16T04:10:37Z,0

I'd have about 5-6 spliffs  (3 skinner) every night on weekdays. Weekends. Double it.....at least. I gave up weed/cigs last June/July & quit, using patches. Having given up cigs (not weed) back in 2010, I knew the side effects of leaving patches on whilst sleeping. The dreams were as vivid and random as anything I can remember. Bearing that in mind, I never kept the patches on when going to bed this time round. Ever since giving up, I have at LEAST 2 dreams a night that are bizarre and as real as I'm typing this. They ALWAYS wake me up. It's gotten to the stage where I want to go back to smoking green again so i can get a decent night's sleep. I've gone from 63kgs to 75kgs !

I really love to grow cannabis and I always choose Sativas, because the booster that it gives me to do daily tasks and strains with higher psychedelic effects are my favorites, some of them are like doing half tab of LSD and are perfect to enjoy music for hours.
Nowadays I'm not smoking (edibles never worked for me and vapes are really expensives here) and I'm going to the gym daily, that helps a lot to sleep, I'm in a transition to eat healthier and when the time of harvest my autos come I wanna to smoke on weekends to don't get tolerance (I used to smoke daily and at one point I hated it, my body and brain was sleepy  and I didn't want it anymore)
Also, smoke is bad for my gums, for everybody's gums.
To everyone who read this: if you like and even if you don't like cannabis as well, learn as much as you can about the plant, it's wonderfull. And if you're dealing with depression, anxiety or whatever, look for help and you'll be better.

@lionessathena8679,"Like another commenter, I've been a chronic insomniac (almost) my entire life - since age 20, I'm now 46. Was a sleep walker as a kid and never could nap. Years of research and investigation, including sleep studies, have never revealed cause or cure. Have tried everything, including behavioral and habit changes, many pharmaceuticals and supplements and herbs. Some of these things have the opposite effect on me - examples are Nyquil, trazadone, and valerian root. Benzos help a lot but they are terrible for your health, especially long term - never going down that road again. Eating low carb helps me some. But the only thing that consistently allows me to get some sleep is cannabis. I have no need to increase my dose, only need to switch strains periodically. I don't take breaks. I find it's certain terpenes that do the trick. I do go through periods of waking up frequently and that is very frustrating, but it comes and goes. A good night is only one or two wake ups with minimal difficulty getting back to sleep. (Just slept through the night - glorious! - that only happens about once a year these days.) I didn't dream much for many years when I took gabapentin, but since quitting that pharmaceutical I dream again. I find deep sleep is what I need the most and struggle to get when sleeping poorly. I do take pharmaGABA (naturally fermented form of the neurotransmitter GABA) and that also helps, but I have to take a big dose for any effect - 1000mg. I don't like feeling dependent on substances to sleep, but the alternative is not sleeping at all and that is terrifying, a viscous cycle, and terrible for short and long term health.",0,2024-03-13T15:01:55Z,0

@automotives6703,"Maybe in the beginning you‚Äôll feel better rested and feel like you had more sleep. However on the long run its not that weed makes you sleep better, its that without weed you‚Äôll sleep much worse

You‚Äôre body will function like it should do without cannabis 
Unless you have you‚Äôre body addicted to cannabis, you SHOULD sleep fine

I‚Äôm a cannabis user and on the long run it will only have negative effects on your health. Addicted people will mostly say that it does have a good effect and it does help them seek whatever they seek for.
Unfortunatly its only you‚Äôre addiction speaking for you.

The reason why I‚Äôm saying this is because people get sold Cannabis because they believe these effects but they are smoking high THC levels and low CBD levels, wich CBD is the part you want for medicinal effects.

People still think that smoking regular cannabis (wich mostly have high levels of THC) will give you the help you‚Äôre seeking for wich will definitely not.

This does not count however for people with medical background or people with proven sleep issues

If you have sleep issues then cannabis should be you‚Äôre LAST option, they are scientific evidences that show there are many better ways / resources to get the sleep you needed

If you need to smoke medicinal weed, then go to you‚Äôre doctor and get a receipt.

If the doctor won‚Äôt give you one, its enough reason to believe you don‚Äôt need it.

And if you are truly stubborn, look for cannabis wich has less than 6% THC and more than 14% CBD.",0,2024-03-12T13:33:25Z,0

@danielchrist8651,"If you have problems sleeping i think using weed is fine but its not a solution its a bandaid. If you truly want to solve your sleep issue or any other issue you have to start looking further inward. Basic meditation can do this very effectively. But you have to think of meditation as a seed or a stair case. Every time you do meditation, you take another step up the staircase or your seed sprouts and grows a little more. It's like performing maintenance on your vehicle, but your body is the vehicle for your life. This is why so many people are suffering. They have never once in their life sat down to change the oil. I believe in the power of psychadelics because i know they work but you have to realize at some point the effect is taking place within you and you can learn do bring those states on if you wish with practice. Once you see that the psychadelic has shown you what's possible, use that as a stepping stone rather than a bainaid. Its takes most people having to use these substances for years on end to see that they are a bandaid and not a solution, but i think thats okay as well as long as you eventually take the next step and dont accept the drug as your plateau.",0,2024-03-12T12:41:18Z,0

I will now use occasionally (again, at night only) for recreation (rare) or when I'm going through an extremely tough time as a (non-ideal) coping mechanism that allows me to at least fall asleep... Dropping the habit afterwards can be hard when such a period happens, but combining insomnia with extreme stress = the worst possible combination for me. Currently in one of those episodes, GF left me in the middle of an extremely high stress period, taking our doggo and resulting in me having to find another place to live etc. Not looking forward to dropping the habit again, but to be honest I'm happy to at least get some sleep and somewhat relax.",1,2024-03-11T17:38:01Z,0

@PoshMurder,"I have CPTSD and a variety of other conditions. I'm prescribed cannabis here in the UK, and it greatly improves my quality of life.

Autism, CPTSD, Anxiety, Depression, slipped discs in my back, diverticular disease (condition of the large intestine), etc.

I've accomplished a lot in my life thanks to the relief cannabis provides. My quality of sleep would most definitely be diminished without it, especially if 7-9 hours is meant to be the 'goldilocks zone' for sleep duration (before I started consuming cannabis I was sleeping around 12 hours, whereas now it's within that 7-9 hours range most of the time).",0,2024-03-11T11:56:18Z,0

Doctors have been telling me not getting enough rem sleep would cause frontal lobe seizures and is a non epileptic seizure but because I was freaking and stressing out during frontal lobe seizure ( I remember nothing from all frontal lobe seizures) I would drop and have a grand maul and that classed me as epileptic.

I have gone through similar experiences using combos of benzos and other pharmaceuticals but pot is still the number one. I wouldn't suggest it anymore as a sleep aid for everyone as I never contributed my history of being abused as a child to the use of it until recently. 

As I get older, exercise and mental stimulation help put me to sleep more with the pot. Pot still helps though. If i'm not getting the Rem sleep necessary then I guess I have to deal with that as it's much better than not sleeping at all.",0,2024-03-09T03:21:53Z,0

However, it does take a toll on my memory and my ability to register what's going on around me. That's why I decided a year ago to quit to see how my body would feel. The moment I came off THC, my body refused to sleep. It couldn't fall asleep and keep me asleep for more than 1-2 hours. I had to take a sleeping pill every 3rd day to force my body to sleep. I told myself it would take a while and my head would straighten out, but after 2 months I gave up. I couldn't function with such a tired body. Once I started THC again my sleep returned to normal.

I also have a microsensitivity to THC, so it barely takes much at all to get me high in the first place. When I do take it before bed, the feeling in the morning is familiar, which sort of confirms my thinking that my ability to dream was somehow inert for years.
But then I of course feel really energized when I wake up after not doing weed now, and have incredible dream recall.

@Trypno,"I‚Äôm actually cutting back on smoking. For about thebpast decade I‚Äôve basically been an ‚Äòall day, every day‚Äô smoker. I tend to stay high all day.

I found though that I‚Äôve been dealing with symptoms of Central Sleep Apnea, where my brain essentially forgets to signal to my lungs to breathe. This most commonly affected me just as I would start drifiting off to sleep, at which point I‚Äôd have to wake back up to breathe again.

I started cutting back last week and have already started noticing an improvement in my sleep, vis a vis, I‚Äôm able to actually fall asleep properly now, and stay asleep longer.

@davestagner,"I‚Äôve found the best solution for sleep is delta-8 + CBN edibles, just before bed. My biggest insomnia problem isn‚Äôt getting to sleep, but rather staying asleep. The edibles help considerably with that. Delta-9 rather than delta-8 tends to wake up the brain a bit. I average just over 7 hours of sleep a night. More important than cannaboids, though I find that the key to getting enough sleep is a consistent bedtime (that gives you enough time to sleep before getting up before work/school/kids/etc), and a strict shutdown routine so you‚Äôre ready to fall asleep when you go to bed. In other words, putting down your phone for an hour before bed is probably more useful and important than THC/CBD!

@pinkdink1210,"Going from a chronic smoker at the age of 15-28, I was more than happy that I decided to take a major break. Instead of using it all day every day, I now much more enjoy it once a day, specifically when I'm relaxing and getting prepared to sleep. Though I only use it 1 - 3 times a week on average. 
After having such a severe habit it was mentally tough to stop, thankfully it's not nearly as difficult as other drugs.

One positive thing I will add, is that at the age of 15 I started having seizures, though I can't say THC was helping control the seizures I think it helped incredibly with anxiety and appreciation of life. Ultimately it assisted in giving me the courage to go under and receive brain surgery and sure enough, haven't had a major seizure in 5+ years.

@jake.notfromstatefarm,"Whatever your thoughts on CBD, you should know that on its own (i.e. isolated from THC), CBD is inert, or inactive. A small amount of THC is needed to ""activate"" the CBD, and that's part of why dispensaries offer various ratios in their CBD products. It doesn't have to be a psychoactive dose. Below that threshold, it's called a therapeutic dose. It's not enough to get anyone high, but it _is_ enough to get the cannabidiol working. Without THC to catalyze it, it won't work. CBD products from places that aren't allowed to sell THC do not contain any and are ineffective.

@StatikV87,"Since I was a little kid, I always had trouble falling asleep, staring at the ceiling for hours before drifting off.  I would also regularly have crazy lucid dreams. It was found that I actually had a very restricted airway causing sleep apnea which would sporadically have me wake myself up.  After getting my tonsils & adenoids out, I'd be waking up less in the middle of the night and thus it ended up that I would remember lucid dreams less frequently.  I was feeling more rested, but was disappointed I didn't remember as many cool dreams.  For about 10 years now, I've averaged smoking probably 1/5 gram or so per night close to bed time.  It is in place of having a cocktail before bed like some folks do, had positive impacts on my depression/anxiety, and helped me fall asleep fast.  However, I have barely remembered any dreams in the last decade.  Surprisingly, my tolerance hasn't gone up much, still being able to benefit from 1-3 decent hits.  Either way, I am between jobs at the moment and not buying/smoking weed.  I dealt with a stretch of insomnia when I first ran out, but things are slowly seeming to normalize.  Hoping I start getting more quality REM sleep and maybe the cool lucid dreams will come back as a result.  Cheers.",0,2024-03-04T03:37:07Z,0

Obviously not advocating heroin, but i used to smoke hash and weed/skunk joints almost daily from 13 til around 22-23 years old, and six month after i stopped it was as if my whole brain woke up, everything got easier, i slept better and lost all the mild paranoia that many thc smokers deal with.

@DrumWild,"I never thought that Ken would talk about cannabis.

Tried cannabis when I was 12 and noted that it helped me with sleep and focus. Started developing my own plan, where I vaporize 0.33 grams of Indica cannabis for sleep [I NEVER use more than this, and only use it at the time I have prescribed]. I use it for about 12 months on, then 6-8 months off.

I do NOT indulge or party.

When I do this, I can get a solid six hours of sleep. Without it, I might get 5 hours, but in 2-3 time chunks. The issues driving my insomnia and racing mind were not discovered until late 2017. Autism, Major Depressive Disorder, and other things. People like me typically don't live to be ten years old, and I will be 60 this year.

@evanledge,"hey man im high, here's what i know:

eat a mango, smoke a bowl. you get higher. terpenes. myrcene specifically. terpenes are found in all kinds of plants...mangoes, citrus, pepper, etc. not just cannabis. each strain has its own ""signature"" of terpene presence and amount. it is also a heavy factor in how each strain smells. Myrcene is also found in basically all cannabis strains, hence why eating a mango and ""generally"" smoking weed works to strengthen your high. indica strains TEND to be heavy with myrcene, while Sativas TEND to not. (they still got it tho)

terpenes are the oils in the buds and plant matter centered around the trichomes. theres alot of different terpenes, so its hard to list them out. my favorite is Terpinoline, because it amplifies the effects of the other terpenes around it. its the ""volume knob"" terpene! the crystals you always see when you shine a light on a bud are the concentrations of cannabinoids (THC, CBD, etc) terpenes are why you need humidity control (along with the grind quality and other physical parts of smoking) with humidity and time comes mold, so be cautious! (hint: boveda packs are dope!)

now go buy pure THCa (unheated THC) isolate (as in isolated from the rest of the source material...its pure thc) and add that to your bowl instead of eating a mango before hand. still a strong effect, pretty different feeling though.

now go buy a vape. if its a distillate, its going to have less terpenes, but super high THC content. if its a live resin (or some variation) cartridge, it has a lot MORE terpenes in it, and a drop in THC content (still higher thc then the strongest flower tho) 

Edibles don't really have terpenes in them, but the maker of those edibles can add supplemental cannabinoids. your label on the package (in a legal state) should list the amounts of THC, THCa, CBD, CBN, CBG, and CBC (sometimes). if you dont see added cannabinoids, your just eating gummy, flavored, THC...regardless of indica, sativa, or hybrid words/colors on the package. each cannabinoid does different things to your body. CBD is more for pain management,  and relaxation. CBN is more sedative, and used commonly in my area as a ""nighttime"" cannabinoid. CBG and CBC are described as mood boosters and motivation enhancements (energy but not in a caffiene way) but i forgot which one is which.

 ill be straight up...theres more and more variations of THC being found...i only trust THC and THCa (same thing, except one hasnt been heated yet). theres discussions about whether Delta9THC and THC are the same things, i have no opinion...i dont know. i do know Delta8THC is not found in the cannabis your meant to consume. there are things like ""Industrial Hemp"" used for more of its physical properties, that Delta8THC can be found in, but it doesnt really function like a THC molecule in your body. its much weaker feeling. 

so take all this knowledge, and apply it. combine your terpenes, your strains! look online at the terpene profiles of your favorite (smokeable) flower! take edibles with just THC, then take edibles with added CBD, then see what CBG feels like, then! eat an edible and then smoke after! That entire adventure is you seeing what the ""Entourage Effect"" is. combining different amounts of terpenes and cannabinoids, low thc, high thc. see what you as an individual prefers. take interest in whats been helping you out so much!

if you don't live in a legal area, then you don't know what your smoking unless you grew it yourself, and even then....where'd you get the seed? be thankful your able to get high, and have a trustworthy source. im not knocking that life. up until recently that WAS my life.

if you do live in a legal area, then all of these little experiments should be possible, and i hope your off on a journey to find what works for you.

@bobparkes2493,"I have tourettes syndrome. Its to this day, even by the people who have it, it is enormously misunderstood. In the one session I have had with a tourettes professional in my life he described it like this- when you have tourettes, the neurons and signals in your brain basically move so much and so frequently that many signals will often end up in the completely wrong place or be sent with 0 intention of them ever happening. which explains tics very well, but also does a great job to explain why most people with tourettes would probably also testify to: having terrible handwriting, having more energy than makes sense, mentally and physically, not being able to keep particular thought processes in your brain for extended periods of time, not being able to sleep because you cannot clear your head or do anything during that day that will bring your energy down. i think I can genuinely say that for the first 11 years of my life I never slept more than 4 hours in a night, and despite that never ending lack of sleep, every day and I woke and had enough energy to share with every human on the planet to run a marathon each and still have some left over. and I promise there is absolutely 0 over exaggeration in that statement. bedtime was torture for me. having to be alone with my thoughts in complete darkness for up to 3-4 hours at a time with more energy than I even knew what to do with when I was awake. let alone trying to sleep, was complete torture. when I got diagnosed at the age of 11, I got melatonin tablets to help me with my sleep, and they did, I could actually reliably goto sleep and wake up at similar times, but it still wasn't great. When I got to uni, I still never knew what it was like to get real regernative sleep. I was against the idea of weed for a long time because of my biological fathers own issues with substance abustnace, but eventually I gave it a try and the change in my life was astounding. It finally let me slow all the processes in my brain down, I could relax, spend time thinking and reflecting on things for extended periods of time. The change in my life has been indescribable. I actually started getting real, consistent sleep, and my body started to feel what that was like, the differences it made to my emotions and mental clarity. Alongside this, since I could now concentrate, I had time to reflect on the way I was living my life, thinking about how lucky I was to have the things I do and be where I was, the depression I thought I was suffering from is gone. I eliminated all the bad things from my life like my video game and pornogrophy addictions, processed food reliance, started working out consistently and making real friendships and deep connections with people, and above all else my tics and side affects of my touettes were oblitereated, not just while i was high, but now I've learnt what it feels like to slow my brain down, and sorted out all the other issues in my life, the significance and struggle with my tics is a fraction of what it used to be. I now sleep everyday with no weed or tablets or assistance within 30 minutes of going to bed. for the first time in my life i can dream multiple times a night and remember what happened. All of the amazing things i have now in my life, as well as the things i had before but didn't realise. I attribute it all to the help i received as a result of smoking marijuana. For me, at least, it truly was a miracle drug, and it saved my life. And its affects were so paramount, and affected me so deeply, that despite my love for it, i no longer even need it, and i have learnt to have the self control to say no to these things, and instead enjoy them on occasion. Regardless of the fact i now consume it much less, i will be forever grateful for its effects on me and the lessons i learnt as a result of it.

@alexwilcox9559,"Just about at week 3 of no use. I smoked pretty much daily from the age of 17-27. I just kind of thought about it one day, realizing I've spent more of the last decade of my free time stoned rather than sober, and it just kinda hurt me. I had essentially forgotten what going to bed sober was like, as I told myself I needed weed to sleep, which was true at that point. I was just perpetually tired, and my head felt foggy constantly. It began affecting my performance at work. My superiors didn't notice anything, but I certainly did. I personally felt stupid which I know I'm not, and I just wanted something to change in my life. I decided to quit for at least 8 weeks, and then afterwards determine what I would do from there.

What I can say so far is that my sleep has dramatically improved. The first week without it absolutely sucked, as I would lay awake in bed for hours before falling asleep and I missed being okay with boredom, especially in the winter. But after duking it out for the first week, I'm actually waking up in the morning and not having issues getting out of bed, or for sleeping 9 plus hours. It's already allowed me to find other things to keep me busy, rather than just getting stoned and playing video games by myself. 

I'm not knocking at people who consume it daily, as it would be extremely hypocritical of me to do so, but I do encourage people to try and take a break. You might surprise yourself on how much more you can get done in a day, and how you actually can begin to fall asleep quickly again without it. Plus, your short term memory will insanely improve. I know it's not going to be my last time ever using it, but I do want to make it my last time consuming it by myself, and without being in a social setting.",0,2024-02-24T02:11:07Z,5

Its meant to look like one guy shares his positive experience then other random people ask how they sourced their substance. Then the first guy or another account will suggest some Shroom guru or a website. Others may chime in and say ""Oh I went to them and everything was great"". THIS IS A SCAM THIS IS A SCAM THIS IS A SCAM. Its meant to send you to said website thinking you just saw impromptu first hand positive reviews - THIS IS A SCAM. Not only will you lose your money but you will probably give up some crucial personal info as well like debit card #'s etc. Plus you should never buy drugs from strangers online. To the scammers, first off you are a piece of excrement. People are desperate to have their mental illness treated, they have been fed garbage SSRI's and atypical antipsychotics for years, maybe decades yet nothing has worked. Then you take advantage of their desperation and rip them off. Do you have no shame? Are you even human? What did any of these people do to you? This has become a big problem in the psychedelic community. So a buddy of mine, Rob primarily on Facebook, keeps a LIST of all you guys.

I also agree that it has huge medical benifits but society has use using it recreationally rather than respecting it as a medicine, as with anything the more you use it the less effect it eventually will have, leading us to seek stronger means (of cannabis) or increased usage and that's when the danger happens. Respect the flower the same way we should respect the mushroom, that's my 2 pence.",20,2024-02-12T07:23:52Z,2

@FinallyAlmino,"I want to give you a sincere thank you for making this information available. This is the type of stuff I never would have heard of from my stoner friends. Cannabis is common but not yet legal where I live, but I used to live in a different country and I was prescribed a thc/cbd spray by my doctor to fight my life long insomnia problems. It helped for a while but I built up a tolerance to the spray and started smoking instead, and since I only ever use it for sleep, and have done so for multiple years, I recognise all the things you mention in this video. 

You've given me a lot to think about, poor sleep is my single biggest health concern (as poor sleep amplifies all my other issues) and cannabis has been my most reliable anti anxiety / anti depressant / sleep aid for years, but if all those withdrawal symptoms are from a lack of healthy REM sleep I need to think long and hard about the road ahead. 

Honestly kinda giving me a bit of panic just thinking about losing my nightly routine, but thanks to you I'll try to stay off it for a while to reassess. 

If anyone has read this far, do you have any tips about safe nightly dosages or some kind of every-other-day type of protocol or something? Any help is appreciated ‚ù§ üëç ‚ò∫Ô∏è",0,2024-02-12T07:13:03Z,0

This really started to scare me and made me think that one day this wel cause a heart attack.

So I quit for 2 weeks now. Even tho it was so hard. But I passed the withdrawal fase. I am sleeping normal again and haven‚Äôt felt anything weird with my heart for the past 2 weeks. I think this is the moment I quit and go on with my life. 
I also started to feel better mentally. I always thought that smoking helped me with my depression. But now I started to realize that smoking actually caused the depression. 
The thing is that I smoked about 2 to 3 joints a day and I think that it was too much.

@BurninSven1,You are way to young to have an opinion about this at all cause there are so many variables in play you have not even heard of yet. I have been smoking cannabis since I was 18 and am now 70. While smoking I did not dream pretty much at all and now that i have quit smoking I dream every night. I stopped cause one day about a year ago I passed out at the dinner table. Lucky me a few relatives came by cause my wife is handicapped with MS since 40 years so she is in a wheelchair and she could not help me. I could have been in the car going to the store or whatever but I was lucky I was at home. I ended up in hospital for a week and the doctor said I have a heart problem so I am on meds for that now. After reading up on weed and using it I understand that it can make your heart rate go sky high specially when you are older and maybe that is what happen to me. Using cannabis as medicine probably works very good specially to easy pain and cramps etc etc but then you take micro doses maybe in sprayform orally like the medicine Sativex which my wife gets and you do not smoke it at all. There is chance I got a small stroke too cause my balance is messed up today and I lost 50 % of my vision on my right eye but I do not know so I quit smoking weed to be on the safe side.,0,2024-02-09T01:50:02Z,0

The rebound-thing is interesting, because I have reeeaally bad phases when I don't have sth to smoke (illegal here, no direct contact, not much money, etc), but in most cases those where times of really high stress, too. In general weed helps me to stay away from alcohol and yes, I pick sleeping at all over a hand full of nights of sleeping objectively good :D
Falling asleep for me -> problematic. Ultra realistic, energy consuming dreams -> problematic. Waking up regularly at Night, mostly not just once -> problematic. Not getting out of bed due to depression and ending up sleeping (with interruptions) for like 12-14+h a day -> problematic.
So yeah, for me in my personal experience, smoking helps with all of these problems and even though I do feel off/dazed/not that fit sometimes too, it's really not worse than the regular depression lol.

@eccomi21,"@@wafflytundracoming from someone who smoked light doses every day for a year, IDK. It kinda stopped helping after about 9 months because I got too used to it, I think you need a break for at least a couple of days if not weeks to truly give your brain time to reset.

It depends on your dose, basically, as well as the strain and your person itself. Obviously, smoking daily can further cancer risks way more than smoking very occasionally. I read some time back that with cigarettes the danger comes not from how much a day, but how many days in a row, basically the regularity, not the amount.
I'd recommend you get a good vaporizer to ‚Äústeam‚Äù the weed instead of burning it, more efficient, fewer carcinogens if any at all, still not harm free.",1,2024-03-26T17:12:38Z,

@andrewgowens1175,"Started at 16 I am 33. This video is very helpful. I've had sleep issues since I was a kid being prescribed seroquel and then later trazadone. Started smoking weed daily and started getting the best sleep of my life or so I thought. About 3 ¬Ω to 4 years ago I noticed that if I didn't have it I didn't sleep like for days until I got more I'm not exaggerating. Side note I do construction and have since I was 17  so I'm definitely exerting a lot of energy and would feel very tired at night but would not sleep. I  have taken 2 benadryl and up to 40 milligrams of melatonin at the same to try and sleep and still wouldn't. Weed and alcohol where the only things that would work. Drank every night for the past 10 years also. About 3 years ago. I had an overnight very dramatic permanent change in my vision which turned out not to be a big deal but for the two weeks I had to wait until I found that out I went through alot mentally and emotionally as I wondered if something was wrong with me and  was I going to die? who would take care of my three young kids? That day in October of 2020 I repented of my sins and put my faith in Jesus Christ and became his disciple. The Bible says there's nothing wrong with having a drink sometimes. Jesus did and the bible says there will be new wine in heaven Isiah 25:6 (if God is making it its probably some good stuff, aparently when Jesus made wine at that wedding it was way better than what men had made)  I also am grateful God gave us the marijuana plant it does have some wonderful medical properties, not sure we should smoke it though it's not good for the lungs and it does have a high potential for abuse. Over the past 3 years I have tried off and on to quit because i felt thats what God wanted me to do as i prayed and yet couldn't because of the lack of sleep. After praying about it I've let drinking and smoking  go and can sleep with a minimal amount of melatonin and some low milligram gummies, which I have been working towards weening myself off of those as well as I have been taking less and less.

@clarissef.7,"Hi thanks for your well explained video. I like the drawings as well! üôåüçÅ

I've been a weed smoker for a while when living in Barcelona (social clubs are legal so it's easy to buy)
My nature is being a good sleeper but usually I go to sleep late and wake up later also, I'm more a night person
When I was smoking every night I had difficulties waking up in the morning, more than used to be and when I stopped (bit by bit without much pb) I noticed my dreams were coming back during my sleep, I had forgotten how it was to dream, I was always saying I never remember my dreams, it's normal for me but nooo it wasn't actually üòÖ

Besides you didn't really separate sativa and indica which are 2 different kind with different effects, sativa would be more used during parties keeping you awake and thinking, so good to have deep conversations with friends for ex, but if you're feeling bad when smoking it, can results in a bad trip when alone (or not) because it can make you more paranoide, making you think about many things / Indica is better before going to sleep, it will relax you, good for an creative activity as well. Most of the time, the weed you buy is cut half half or 70%/30% or else or pure aha

So the type of weed can also play, I'm the same person but according to my mood or what I smoke or the situation I'm living (if I'm alone or with friends, people I barely know, outside or inside etc) it will change my reaction and my sleep. But of course some people will react always good to weed others always bad..

But well in my opinion it's still better than hashish üòÇ
Funny fact btw, in France we call hashish ""shit"", voil√† that's all for me today üòé

@steph2521,Hello everyone I am a certified cannabis consultant there has been studies on how sleep and CBD can help. CBD can quiet the mind and help with the racing thoughts but CBN is the one that people want to look into for sleep. CBN is a muscle relaxer so it helps with that better quality sleep. BUT Blending cannabinoid‚Äòs will work synergistically so they will enhance the benefits of one another try blending CBN CBD and THC. As for dosing it‚Äôs all about finding the milligram amount that works perfectly for you for me I take a gummy called triple Z from the brand ZAR. This Gummy has 15 mg of CBN 10 mg of CBD and 10 mg of THC and 2.5 mg of melatonin (I take 1/2) This combination is perfect for sleep and overtime puts your sleep cycle back into balance.,0,2024-01-28T00:20:31Z,0

PTSD, pain management,  and a very few other finite medical conditions may be the few exceptions.  Addressing all the many reasons a person can't sleep before turning to a drug is always the preffered choice.  But it takes more effort and resolve from the patient.  Esp anything that develops a tolerance over time, that's a red flag it's not ideal for the body/mind.  But as long as the business is bringing in millions of dollars, it will touted as the answer.  Period.  Alcohol will also solve many of those issues.  But its on the negative marketing side now, pot is making tins of cash and now on the positive side, soniys being pushed.  And what person who doesn't enjoy smoking pot isn't going to rejoice that their drug of abuse is being touted as the ultimate answer.  Duh. Thats where the marketing. ones in.  Alcohol and heroine also lessen anxiety, reduce PTSD symptoms, etc, but that doesn't make them the solution.

Every night would be a crazy long dream (I hadn't had a single dream in over a year). And they were all dreams of me reliving my childhood, but always in some sort of weird dystopia! Also I got deja vu very often after waking up, the dreams almost felt like repressed memories from a past I never had. It's crazy what the brain can do.

5 months of no weed now. The dreams still happen occassionally, but much less often.

I think we often also overlook other contributing factors that affect sleep like stress, alcohol, caffeine consumption, diet, level of fitness, etc that also play a role. I‚Äôm also weary of studies conducted in the US due to its aggressive lobbying by pharmaceutical companies that are trying to create  paranoia around Marijuana.

@buzzdb66,"I've had insomnia issues basically my entire adult life. Some nights I would be lucky to get 3 hours of sleep and I would probably wake up twice during those 3 hours, so I definitely wasn't getting any REM sleep. I used to smoke a lot of weed in my teens, but then stopped for almost a decade because it started giving me bad panic attacks and anxiety at the time. Now that weed is recreationally legal in my state I've started buying low dose thc gummies and eating 20-30mg of thc before bed each night. Edibles are much more gentle to me because of the gradual come up, and 20-30mg is a small enough dose where I almost never get anxious. The positive effect on my sleeping habits has been insane though. Instead of tossing and turning for 2 hours before falling asleep each night, I can pretty much lay down, close my eyes and be asleep in 5 minutes. I also stay asleep for 7-8 hours. It's amazing and I feel so much better these days since I'm not sleep deprived 24/7. I've been doing this nightly for about 2 years now. When my tolerance starts going up a bit, I just reduce the dose to 10mg nightly for a couple weeks and my tolerance goes back down. The gummies I get are really cheap too, it only costs me about $1.00-$1.50 worth each night. I'm insanely thankful to be able to get these now since they have been such a drastic help. Not being able to sleep is such a frustrating issue to go through and you feel terrible all the time. It's definitely worth trying for people with similar problems, and it doesn't leave me a groggy zombie for hours in the morning like sleeping pills do.",0,2024-01-16T20:49:23Z,0

Ive had intense trouble falling asleep my entire life, till I found pot. Now as an adult having smoked for over 20 years now, I can confidently say that pot does help regukate my sleep, but it holds hand in hand with having a set bedtime and wakeup time everyday. Ive heard theres such a thing as having an extended circadian clock, or something, where unstead of your internal clock having 24 hours it paces out more like 26 or 27. If I am not smoking and don't have a specific time I have to be up everyday, I will get to sleep 1-3 hours later every day or every other day, until it goes around the clock entirely.

@wisdomsleuth77777,Yeah I don't believe that sleep study results. I think there's more to it than what they were observing and a lot of it will depend on the strain and the person who's smoking.

@wisdomsleuth77777,the other thing to point out is some people react differently to weed it's kind of like if you have asthma and inhaler will work if you don't have asthma it doesn't change. Some people wake up on weed some people get extra sleepy. I'm one of those that tend to wake up on weed but the minute I decide to go to sleep I am out and I get a very restful sleep. I'm also someone who can drink a pot of coffee and go to bed if I choose the caffeine would not interfere with that. Decades ago before I ever smoked I had the hardest time staying awake on long drives despite anything that I did. Once I started smoking I realized it would wake me back up because it felt like my mind would become active enough to keep me awake on those long trips. I don't trust everybody to be extra tired to smoke and then wake up sometimes it has that opposite effect and makes them sleepy and of course then they're strains and dosing and how it was consumed. I'm also someone who doesn't seem to get the effects of Edibles the way some people do. Thank you for doing this informative video,0,2024-01-12T21:06:02Z,0
@paulhpxinc,"First off - excellent summary of the existing research! I‚Äôm in healthcare, always doing research, and I know many doctors that have missed points you are bringing up, such as dosage dependent tolerance. 

I want to add an important point, and maybe get your response - my reading on sleep studies seemed to indicate that marijuana can actually promote positive effects on sleep for the first week of use. And then, after that, it is much like you said. So, if this is true, then the question becomes what would the effect of cycling use or intermittent usage be?

@Sheilanagig,"With PTSD you get nightmares. THC prevents you from entering the sleep stage where you would have those vivid dreams. Instead you keep it to the sleep stage just before REM and you have routine dreams, daily impressions, but no nightmares. In the balance, you're getting sleep and not having nightmares at the expense of some of your sleep quality. Half a loaf is better than none, because if you're not sleeping at all, your mental state tends to deteriorate faster. It becomes a negative feedback loop. So it's a tradeoff.",0,2024-01-12T08:36:05Z,0

@PhilipPedro2112,"Cannabis generally intensifies whatever I am experiencing. If I am exhausted and I smoke, I can fall asleep rapidly and awake fully rested. But normally, for the first hour or two after smoking, I enter a state of mental excitement similar to being on amphetamine that gradually declines and becomes one of calm and sedation. During that initial stage, increased thought makes sleep almost impossible. I may not recall any dreams or may, near the end of a full sleep cycle, awake from a dream. I do notice that when withdrawal from chronic use, I have intense and numerous dreams in a night's sleep.
I believe maybe something in cannabis is performing the action found in REM sleep, making the brain's need for REM unnecessary.

@vishyoutubevideos,"I'd been a chronic weed user for nearly the last 30 years.  For the first 20 or so years of that, I smoked off a one hitter quitter all day long.  But, then I started not enjoying smoking and wasn't really getting the old ""high"" that I used to.  So, I sort of quit for a while.  It was about that time that the electronic cartridges came along.  So, of course I had to try it.  And of course, I fell in love all over again.  I had been on those in much the same way for the last 10 years or so.  That was until about a month ago when I took a drag off a 98% pure THC cart with a fully charged battery.  Right in the middle of the work day.  It caused me to go into RVR Atrial Fibrillation and to the hospital in an ambulance.  Needless to say, it scared me shitless.  Lesson learned.  You can sort of overdose on weed.   On the plus side, I don't do that stuff all day long anymore and I'm actually better for it.  Maybe one or two puffs at night while practicing guitar.  My dreams have returned with vivid imagery.  Just like you mentioned in your video.  I am not as moody, although still a bit.  Life is much better I""d say.",0,2024-01-10T13:50:46Z,0
@eliinthewolverinestate6729,What a bunch of crap. I take an edible or some kraken black pepper weed and I am out and get great sleep. Some sativa and I ain't getting any good sleep. It's all about the terpenes and cbd not thc. I will say smoking some Rick Simpson oil puts me out too and it's not the thc. Does this make sense to other cannabis users?  There is day time weed and night time weed. It can even be the same cultivar only difference when it was harvested. I know at least 2 terpenes cause insomnia not the thc.,0,2024-01-10T12:40:14Z,0

@dannynannady,"100% with you all the way. Here's the big take away from this guys comment.
If your life gets better (more energy/motivation etc.) after taking a break from weed...  then maybe you should take a look at yourself and consider quitting.

I've been smoking for a long time and one thing that a lot of weed smokers don't realize  is how complacent it makes you. You may not realize it until it's too late.
Missed calls or appointments that could have led to some doors opening for you... Conversations/calls that could have probably lead to friendships/relationships or whatever it might be... 
But they all passed you by without you taking appropriate action because of the weed clouding your mind/judgement.
I honestly would never recommend smoking weed to young people or young adults as it can really influence what direction your life goes and in my experience it is usually in a bad or worse direction.
Weed is a lot more insidious than a lot of young people believe, take it from someone that has been smoking for 15+ years...

But I'm not here to preach. To each his own man, just putting my 2 cents out there. Maybe someone might read this one day and maybe gain a new perspective.
Peace.",6,2024-03-09T01:24:29Z,

All I'm saying is that your experience is NOT representative of 98-99% of daily weed smokers and it's important that people (especially young people) realize this.

@Cococonutt,"The narrative that weed is harmless, non-addicting, withdrawal free and will fix all of your ailments is something that I fed into 7 years ago. 7 years later I went from ambitious, social, healthy to fat, homeless, socially awkward with no friends and poor relationships with my family. Eventually I forget what it felt like to be sober and being high was the only normal. People begin to notice, non-smokers don‚Äôt want to be around you, you lose respect and quality friendships. But the only thing that mattered was the next high, when I could escape and just chill. It was so easy to ignore my problems, ignore bills, ignore messages, ignore goals, ignore my future, just light up a joint and put it off to tomorrow. One day I woke up and realized I had nothing to show for the last 7 years, no quality memories, no real friendships, no achievements, no goals met, time melted away, I wasn‚Äôt present, I was high, escaping off to nowhere.

@ry1255,"agree 100%~ was a THC smoker since I was 24 EVERY NIGHT (yes, every night) due to intense insomnia since I was 18. Was on sleeping meds but quit because it made me a zombie. At 24, my buddy told me to try weed to sleep. Tried it 1st time and had the best sleep ever. I'm 36 now, and since Oct of last year, my tolerance got way too high (no pun intended) to the point where the weed wasn't helping me sleep anymore. Of course, I was petrified of quitting because the weed was a maricle for my insomnia since 24. All my insomnia fears came back and hit me hard AF my first 5 days of qutting (literally, NO SLEEP, was the most mental torture those 5-6 days of no sleep). Fast forward to now, I am no longer a slave to needing weed (nor ANY substance) to help me sleep. I give my thanks/gratitude to my sleep coach from the sleep coach school YouTube channel, Daniel Erichsen, for curing my insomnia fears. I took my first toke a few weekends ago (not for sleep, but just wanted to chillax) and GOLLY it felt like the first time again. I now smoke a few hits on the weekends, and all I need is 1 hit to get me there, and I always knock out eventually lol. Also, my dreams have been intense but I really enjoy remembering most of my dreams. When I was a nightly smoker, I didn't remember ANY dreams. I didn't know what it felt like to wake up feeling refreshed vs. getting 6+ hours of sleep on weed and wake up feeling tired/groggy still... Additionally, I really like how I have more energy now (even on nights that I lack sleep). My short term memory has also came back 10 fold and I don't need to re-read things over and over to comprehend (when I used to smoke nightly, I didn't do it all day; it was mainly smoking at night time but tolerance got way too high). I also don't overeat anymore and mentally sharper and stronger at the gym (gym rat for 20 years). Weed is a medicine, and just like any medicine, if one takes it regularly and/or abuse it, tolerance will get ridiculous and the ""magic"" will dissapate. I'm  so happy that I stopped and now if I want to smoke, I do it as a way to relax vs. praying that it will help me sleep.

I rely on it to help me to sleep at night because I take man-made opiates , morphine, muscle relaxants, anti-spasm drugs for a serious back condition which, when it comes to sleep at night I'm still wired on them, because I use adrenalin during the day to fight against the relaxing effects of those drugs, if I didn't push any adrenalin against it I'd be, and have done, falling asleep all of the time, which gets nothing done.

@icestationzebraassociates2460,"I can definitely confirm the affect on REM sleep, HOWEVER:

(keep in mind this is just personal experience)

I have started using legally available farm bill THCA flower. THCA is a precursor to delta 9 (and a component of regular old weed - in fact, it is one of the major measures of good weed - the percentage of THCA is usually labeled along with d9 percentage in states where cannabis is legally available.) and is not psychoactive until you put flame to it. I have noticed that since then, I have dreams again. It _could_ be that certain terpenes are responsible for the detrimental sleep effects and they're not present in THCA flower. I do not know, but since it's legally available, would recommend giving it a shot and seeing if your situation doesn't improve.

It works the same and, imho (27 year smoker - usually daily) is actually better. There's a little place called Greenlight Natural that ships and it's no more expensive than black market...just a little tidbit.",0,2023-12-26T04:58:27Z,0

@simplyk8lyn975,"This is very interesting! I‚Äôve had a lot of trouble sleeping for nearly my entire life, smoking before bed makes me so much more tired than I have have ever felt naturally, recently I‚Äôve had such bad insomnia I‚Äôve been awake 24+ hours multiple days of the week. I also don‚Äôt wake up throughout the night like I do when I don‚Äôt smoke (and have every night before I ever even tried it)! It‚Äôs very interesting how differently our bodies can react to drugs! The weed also helps my body pain and the chronic migraines, but mostly when it starts to wear off I‚Äôm heading tf to bed to finally sleep!!!",1,2023-12-24T08:17:29Z,0
@christopheranderson8275,"I'm a medical cannabis patient treating depression, Bipolar, anxiety and PTSD. I've been experimenting with the individual cannabinoids currently being sold online and have discovered that each cannabinoid has its own properties that treat different ailments. For example, THC is very effective for treating depression yet I find high doses cause anxiety. On the flip I found CBD seems more effective treating anxiety. Shockingly I discovered that by using only THCA instead of a full cannabis extract the appetite stimulation typically created from cannabis is absent. As a result I've managed to lose nearly 100lbs that I've accumulated over all the years I've been self medicating with cannabis flower. We need to further research so we can continue learning more about these cannabinoids by doing so I'm convinced we can eliminate the negative effects and increase the positive effects of these cannabinoids to more safely treat many different medical conditions. Last count I heard was at 114 different cannabinoids have been discovered. Less than 20 are available to the public so far. Much more to learn with this amazing plant. It absolutely has medicinal value! The future looks bright with cannabis!",0,2023-12-24T07:34:33Z,0
@Tiedyeman,"As a person that experiences night terrors, less REM sleep is a blessing. The quality of my sleep is much improved by THC, along with the quality of life and my continued existence. Cannabis not only gives me better sleep, but keeps me from needing opioids or other pain killers. It has also caused an unsightly mole on my eyelid to disappear completely and eliminated the arthritis pain in a finger completely as well as shrinking the swollen knuckle back to nearly it's original size. I find tolerance to be a myth in my personal experience, I do not need to keep increasing the amount I use. I have never experienced ""negative"" effects from cannabis other than the misunderstanding and intolerance of other people.",13,2023-12-24T05:32:48Z,2

@thetallerindian7031,"So as a user for over 8 years now, I'd like to break some stigmas and probably send you to the right path regarding weed. First, quitting any kind of addictive substance is the best solution but some of you just want it in your life just like me. I've been there chasing a better weed high and consuming more each day. But it's not really the key. Chasing a bigger high will lead you to do just that in your everyday life. What I do now is smoke half a joint a day and that does it for me. I can focus on everything else and I can enjoy my preferred form of recreation a lot more. I got dreams too. I sleep for 7 to 8 hours a night and everything's just right. So, I'd encourage everyone to do this. If you use a bong daily just use it for 2 hits everyday. And if you're into edibles, just know one thing. Unless the amount of weed used in the cookie is really low, you'll feel the high from an edible a lot longer than smoking it. So even though smoking is the unhealthy process, the high is a lot more manageable and practical. Also, NEVER drive while high. Be responsible, and if you've got to drive right now, don't consume it. Give yourself atleast 2 to 3 hours after consuming it before you drive. If you're at the early stages of smoking it give yourself about 7-8 hours before driving. Please be responsible with your weed and hopefully we can literally give the world a lesson that potheads can be responsible with their weed. Criminalizing it was a big bad move for the world and now, with the help of the internet we can teach people worldwide to be responsible with it.",0,2023-12-15T05:33:53Z,3

REM sleep is also part of what hypnotists use to get ppl to act like idiots. (granted ppl who suffer from elongated REM sleep wont fall for it as easy, however if not awake and actually sleepwalking they will follow simple commands if done in rights tones and loudness.)

Same with alcohol, cigarrets or any other drug. Your body will work and feel much better if you stay away from them or if you do not abuse from any of these.
If you have being smoking weed for a wile. Try it. Put it aside for about a year and then enjoy yourself, your inner energy, your natural happiness. You will notice the diference from being under the influence of a substance or your real you.",0,2023-12-01T16:05:44Z,0

@i.k.8868,"I think you should have explained more clearly the relationship between REM sleep/dreams, and memory. People who suffer from PTSD are able to cope with life because THC helps them block parts of their memory. During the day it helps them stay calm and focus on the task at hand, while at night it dampens the nightmares. That is why so many people take it just to get through life. But the flip side is that people who take THC daily are much less able to form new long term memories, which are needed to deal with traumatic emotions such as grief or guilt. Your dreams are a way to compress your experiences of the past few weeks/months into a single (or a few) long term memories. Like a very crude summary or diary. This compression, while painful, also turns the subjective experience into a more abstract, distant event. It is like a .rar file being written and read at the same time. That is why time moves so much faster in your dream world. So for people suffering from PTSD, THC can help them to be able to function on a daily basis, but they are not being treated. They need Psychotherapy or some other therapy to get over their trauma. THC and trauma therapy don't go well together. Smoking weed is a temporary solution, and if you become dependent on it, you should seek professional help.

@MrAnimalelvis,I used cannabis for 22 years I saw it as a way to out of myself who spent ten years in the Marine Corps. It was my reprogramming into a gentler kinder soul so I thought. It wasn‚Äôt until my recent mind shift was I able to take an extended break. The insomnia that followed was amazing I was able to accomplish and learn so much. My biggest was learning a sleep routine for I needed more sleep and it was amazing having dreams again. I am hesitant to use again for the detox from my habit was a challenge and eye opening to who I now am.

@AlonsoArayaAudiovisual,"heyy what a great video. felt identified every minute. 

My case is....I've been smoking daily for almost 4 years. I'm 36 now. II had a six month break at the beginning of this year. And now I'm going through a week of withdrawal so my experience is fresh. 

I sleep 9 hours  on weekends. During the week not less than 6 and not more than 7 hours. I have always had difficulties falling sleep. Too much intrusive thoughts and I am a very anxious person. But after I started using sleeping inductor pills, this was kind of fixed. But...if I had a very difficult day, even with the pill I had trouble falling asleep, so I found that smoking kinda enhanced the effect of the sleeping aid pill. But there is a catch, If a smoke a small dose, it activates me, my brain and fall asleep later than I wanted. So I have to smoke a lot now. 

I have been smoking 2-3 joints a day.  After work. I think it's a lot. I started with 1/3 of a joint per day in 2020.   Before this, I was a ocational user of marihuana.  Once or twice per week.  Since 2017. And before that, in college, just a few times a year. Say 10 times.  

Also, like the video explained, I have troble increasing my temperature in the morning. I suffer from depression too, and marihuana can increase some of the efffects of depression like a low body temperature. Or even cause more anxiety sometimes and more intrusive thoughts. 

I am starting to realize that at the long run, it is better not to depend on anything external. Your body has it's own chemical factory  and it's wise. But sometimes, like myself, lacked of something in the brain before the use of marihuana, and that made me use it in the first place. Dopamine realease and other quemical reactions that my brain was lacking. But I think that the best solution nowadays is psycological  therapy and sometimes some pill. (I think pharmaceutical as bad as they are, I think they have developed very advanced human technology. With just a small dose of some drug you can have very substantial effects on our lives. 

  But I think we should still use drugs like marihuana, mushrooms, LSD, etc,  bit more in a ritualistic way. In some festivities, special ocations, maybe with some intention or purpose.  Like when we open a bottle of wine.

@Blubberblase7,"great video! much of what you point out I did hear from friends and family members that used regulary thc. hearing from you a bit of the science behind it was quite interesting. For myself it seems to look different, maybe because of the low dosis or the chronic health issues I have. But I do dream more often and more intens after days with higher dosis. And I also sleep longer ( with less interruptions) when I used it shortly before going to bed. I do use just 0.03 gram per day ( I mix it with peppermint for easier handling the small amounts I¬¥m working with). I use thc already for several years and my dosis did actually decrease over time, since my health did improve ( due to the lack of negative symptoms, because of the treatment with thc). So since that  I don¬¥t need any other medications to treat the numerous health issues. I hope more long term studys will be made looking into the benefits and risks of thc and how to use it properly for different issues.",0,2023-10-28T21:07:11Z,0

@Luca95Freestyle,"When THC is in the system you basically sleep more easily, you almost do not realize you're falling asleep and then wake up the following morning, but the REM phase is practically suppressed and that's why you don't dream. You sleep more easily but not necessarily you are more rested.  When you quit smoking abruptly, the REM rebound can make dreams really vivid, the REM phase comes back and you start dreaming again, the thing is you are fully aware of you being in bed trying to fall asleep, and if you are not good enough at avoiding the mind racing thoughts that might occur it is possible it will take many hours to fall asleep. Yet for some reason even if you sleep ""worse"" and less time you will find you have higher energy levels. Anyway, I feel almost like it's needed to smoke once in a while.

(I decarb weed in super small batches, enough for 2-5 highs, and mix 1 high's worth of that with peanut butter and eat it. I typically use strains that are between 20-30% THC and CBD that's either 0 or close to 0-3% but the amount I use is very very small, I can make a mini preroll {0.35 grams in 1 mini preroll} into 3-5 highs when I decarb and eat it. Since I usually will have those highs spaced out to every 2-3 days and then wait like a week or more before I make another batch, this gets me nice and high without needing much and I can keep my tolerance super low at the same time. Especially if I have to work on something that's time sensitive, I will usually avoid getting high until it is done, and sometimes that can be a whole month or longer without getting high.)",0,2023-10-24T07:17:46Z,0

@Dogsarebetterpeople,"I recently quit weed and after the first week I started to dream, which was a trip in itself since I‚Äôd been a regular smoker (mostly vape so pretty much all through out the day user) for so many years (10+). 2nd week without weed- I had never slept so well. I can‚Äôt believe the difference in sleep quality now, I actually get up and don‚Äôt need an hour to ‚Äúwake up‚Äù like I did with weed. I‚Äôm not downing the benefits of marijuana, I know it has many; however for me, I‚Äôd much rather have it as an occasional recreation because I don‚Äôt see the benefits of chronic use. As you get older, your sleep and the quality of your sleep become vital, both to your physical and mental health.

@DeltaMS,In my teens I developed insomnia. Always had issues falling asleep. Once I was asleep I didn‚Äôt want to get up. Around the age of 20 at a party I was offered some weed. Took a puff and within 30 minutes I was passed out on the couch sleeping. That‚Äôs when I realized weed could help me sleep. A decade later and I‚Äôm a heavy smoker smoking away up to 4 or 5 blunts a night just to get high enough to sleep. I had no issues quitting I would quit from time to time for months or even when we had family trips I would not smoke. But I also would suffer from lack of sleep during my break from it. Sleeping pills and melatonin worked sometimes but it wasn‚Äôt enough. I would always go back to smoking weed. But I would immediately feel the negative affects after smoking. The next day I would be so tired. Drinking coffee and energy drinks to get through the day. Weed made me so lazy! I would rather be at home smoking weed than out with my friends enjoying life. A few years ago I got tired of always being high to be able to sleep. Went and got professional help and found the root to my insomnia problems. Now I sleep so much better and have amazing dreams that I did not have while smoking. I wake up rested and no longer need coffee to be productive. Yeah weed can be a fun experience but it also has its dark side. I always wondered why it was illegal for so long and in a lot of states still is. It‚Äôs very addictive and easy and cheap to come by. I don‚Äôt recommend it üòÇ,1,2023-10-19T07:31:30Z,0

@Corgi_fax,Stoners realizing weed is in fact a narcotic not 'healthy stuff that also get you high' be like lol,5,2024-01-05T05:49:42Z,
@dsaikon,"@@Corgi_fax This is so fax actually, coming from a (former) long time stoner. You're told everywhere that weed isn't dangerous or has close to no side effects, but the truth is, it can have many side effects (mostly mental), and works in different ways for different people. 

Weed is no wonder drug that gets you high without consequences. Besides the fact that most people smoke weed with tobacco, which is clearly very unhealthy in itself and causes respiratory issues, it can cause a variety of mental issues in some people that use it chronically. 
Now, I believe that using it sometimes and not on a regular basis is absolutely fine, but using it frequently or even daily, will alter your brain chemistry a lot. Especially if you're still young and developing. Luckily, most of the side effects can be reversed with a long absence from THC, however most stoners will inevitably build not only a tolerance, but also a dependency on weed. You can become irritable, depressed, prone to insomnia and many more things when quitting, which is why everyone says they can quit easily, but only a handful of people actually do it. 
And by far the worst side-effect is that you lose the ability to dream (or to consciously feel your dreams). This is why when quitting, you can expect to have wild dreams in the first 3 weeks. Dreams are very important for the brain guys, don't sleep on them (pun intended)
This only happens with chronic users though, and we can't fully explain why because we don't know enough about the Endocannabinoid System in our body.

Don't just mindlessly consume anything without being aware of what can happen to your body and your self. The same thing applies to alcohol (even more actually), and any other drug out there. Think for yourself, and don't follow other peoples bad decisions.",0,2024-01-05T14:05:01Z,
@streuthmonkey1,@@Corgi_fax It isn't a narcotic. Narcotics are drugs consumed for  non-medical purposes. Weed has may medicinal uses and is consumed by many for medical purposes. You are blinded by ignorance and prejudice.,13,2024-01-05T17:03:04Z,

Post my intense mushrooms experiences and After about a 2 month break with daily meditation I was able to teach myself to lucid dream by meditating as I fell asleep until I could recognize my dreams.

I have been smoking daily with no breaks for about 2-3 years and have very real wild and when I want to and am focused enough lucid dreams every night.

@tricitymorte1,"My situation is quite unique. I've always had issues with insomnia but was only recently diagnosed. I also have depression and anxiety. I didn't smoke weed for years. I've had these issues since I was a child. I also extremely rarely remember my dreams (I usually just say I don't dream, since I wake up and it's basically like I time travelled into the future with no memories of any dreams). I can count on one hand the number of dreams I can remember across my entire 39 years. I do now use weed on a semi-regular basis, but certainly not every day. My tolerance has also been extremely low, since the beginning - low as in 10-15mg. If I go above that by even as little as 5mg, I get very sick. I feel light-headed, extremely weak, my body temperature rises to the point I can feel the heat rolling off of me, and sometimes I end up vomiting, after which I have to lie down. I don't have a choice. I will be unconscious for about an hour. So, I'm very careful about how much I use and how often, and it has been a massive help. I didn't want to be on a bunch of pharmaceutical medications for my mental health issues, and this was the solution to that. Where I live, it's legal recreationally, so I don't need a medical license for it, but my psychologist still offered me one.",0,2023-10-18T00:20:25Z,0

I used to use edibles to help fall asleep almost every night for about 2 years. I stopped because I wasn‚Äôt dreaming and felt groggy in the morning. Like a lot of commenters here are also saying, it felt like the backlog of dreams I hadn‚Äôt been having for 2 years just assaulted me. I had like 2-3 weeks of extremely intense, vivid dreams, and then it felt like my system caught up and went back to normal. That said, I have started keeping a dream journal and have noticed some really important advice, themes, and solutions to problems from what has been coming up. I now consider dreams to be an incredibly useful resource, not just random neural firings, and if I‚Äôd keep doing the edibles, I wouldn‚Äôt have noticed.

@NobleSainted,"@MediocreFilms...
Indeed, your point is valid, and I appreciate you raising it. I would also have appreciated more in-depth info, but I also understand how difficult it would be to prove the information as well since true cannabis testing is still in its infancy.

While some may believe that the only distinction between Sativa and Indica is their appearance, I propose that those with such beliefs conduct a small comparative test of there own to demonstrate the significant differences between the two that I believe exists.

With over 120 cannabinoids, these variations yield diverse Physiological / Psychological effects. Though I'm not a medical professional, extensive research or consultation with experts could provide more detailed insights.

Studies isolating these components are underway, confirming the varied effects of each. Therefore, it's accurate to say that there are notable disparities between Sativa and Indica.

Personally, I prefer Hybrids, which in all honesty dominate medicinal plants today.
Even if the strain is denoted as sativa or Indica, this would actually only denote the _dominance_ of said strain type, not the actual purity. Look at it this way...
Many of today's strains have undergone hundreds of years of crossbreeding (some over a thousand). This also occurs naturally (in the wild without genetic manipulation/crossbreeding) as well.

I hope this sheds light on the topic for some.",1,2024-03-08T20:10:38Z,

@nycbearff,"I'm an old guy, and cannabis in the evening reliably stops my night-time leg cramps, and eases the chronic pain I have from several sources.  None of the medically suggested treatments for those things work nearly as well, and they have worse side effects, some of them much worse.  I do take breaks now and then for a week or two - and then return to the cannabis.  So yes, I'm sure it modifies my sleep.  But, as with most things, it's complicated.  Modern medicine is in it's infancy.  

No one knows why only some people respond to cannabis the way that the majority did in the referenced studies - they were mostly correlation studies, with statistical outcomes, and were mostly done on college students in Western universities. People who didn't have the most common responses were ignored, because studying them further will be very expensive and time consuming.  Eventually, we'll understand our genetics and in vivo cellular processes, and be able to do personalized medicine and personalized recreational highs.  But not in my lifetime - and probably not in yours.  We know very little yet.

@Skulduggeryful,"Initially i started using weed as a way to get away from anxiety and did find that my sleep improved but after being a chronic smoker of bud for several years in a row, i did notice that my dreams became much less frequent and often thought i wasn't dreaming at all. After having quit about a month ago my first week and a half of sleep became very inconsistent and often started to dream about the act of smoking itself (picking the buds apart and rolling up a joint), only to get to the point of it being ready to smoke before my subconscious mind remembered that i have nothing to actually smoke. After that week and a half i started having really vivid dreams and a lot more of them but my quality of sleep hasn't really improved since then. I'm really interested to see how the quality of my sleep changes over the next little while.

@PatPatPotato,"I'm at 3:45 right now. I actually have an interesting comment to this, I have high functioning autism, and I do use THCA and CBD products, as is what's available in my state. I find THC isolate, is very harmful to my sleep. I have to have a mix of other cannabinoids in the flower in order for it to be highly effective. But, speaking on dreams. I actually because of my high functioning autism, have dealt with very vivid, and constant movement and dreams my whole life, making it feel less restful overnight. I actually find the fact that THC kind of controls and brings down my REM cycle, to be nice. Because I feel like I'm actually getting sleep throughout the night instead of constantly watching a very tiring movie, that can feel like real life because of my neurodivergency.

@Pleasure_Baron,"I was high functioning stoner and consumed heavily, chronically for 15+ years and likely have cannabis use disorder. Cannabis started to give me insomnia in the form of segmented sleep cycles ( I couldn‚Äôt sleep more than 3-4 hrs would be up for an hour or more tans then would be back for another sleep block which would require 10+ hrs to get a full 7-8 hours) which is why I quit. Then I experienced wicked rebound insomnia but it went away in a couple long months. Hang in there if you‚Äôre trying, it gets better!

I started using it on the weekend (heavily‚Äî I love cannabis), and the segmented sleep cycles returned even during the week days. I‚Äôm still experimenting with frequency as to not affect my sleep. I might have to go down to once a month or less which makes me sad.

@ridemtb82,"Bottom line is THC reduces the amount of time you spend in REM sleep cycles. It also reduces your ability to dream, which is the time you need to actually process day to day emotions.
Smoked pot steady for 25 years, thought I was getting great sleep, never had dreams. Quit 6 months ago and after the initial few days of the worst insomnia I starting to actually get good sleep and feel well rested, my dreams are the most vivd 4k dreams imaginable.

@treym.4940,"Marijuana has definitely affected my sleep in terms of not remembering my dreams. I've always talked about that and some of my friends say they have more intense dreams while on weed. I've been battling cancer for a bit and I wasn't able to smoke for 8 months, and I had wild/insane dreams + increased pain after having to stop. They were giving me marinol in the hospital to help with hunger while I was getting intense chemo, and it didn't help much. Eventually my doctor allowed me to vape thc + cbd and I've been doing way better with my appetite and mood. I'm able to game again and lose myself in the moment and have some happiness rather than sober in a cruel reality. I'm in remission now thankfully and vape everyday/very often and am glad it's legal. Finally got a medcard. I do wish I could have better REM though and dreams while still smoking.

Not all all cannabis is the same.  You're far more likely to want to go and take a nap after smoking some good indica, whereas you're far more likely to want to do something creative after smoking some good sativa.  ""Weed"" isn't just ""Weed"".  There's a reason most dispensaries have a large menu of products available, categorized by ""indica"", ""sativa"" and ""hybrid"" strains (and occasionally a ""hemp"" category if the dispensary carries strains such as ""Charlotte's Web"").

@openskies11,"I have severe, chronic insomnia. I actually have been to the emergency room and have permanent neurological damage from sleep deprivation. Cannabis (in the form of cannabutter, 5-10 mg) has a been a lifesaver for me, because it does allow me to sleep if I take it in combination with melatonin and doxylamine, and occasionally with gabapentin and valerian on a bad night, I can actually get a full night's sleep. (I also have to wear a CPAP, it's a whole deal.) The part about dream suppression with THC is 100% true though.  If there are nights when I can get by without cannabis, my dreams are far, far more vivid. When I do use cannabis though, I'm still tired throughout the day and mental alertness isn't so great, a sort of sleep medicine hangover. (This is better than my previous sleep med regimen, which was melatonin + 4x the recommended dosage of doxylamine + valerian + almost an entire fifth of rum, vodka, or whiskey.

I fall asleep in about 10 seconds. whenever i want. Before i used to smoke, the usual time to fall asleep was 3 hours.
I always been hard to wake up, since i'm born. smoking didn't made it harder.
I used to recall my dreams and always hated it (reality check is an issue every morning. life in dream was better, every morning was disapointing)
I haven't had a dream or nightmare in memory.

I've had a lot of moment without weed of hash. I'll still fall asleep in 20 second. I never had more than a few days so i'm pretty sure my blood never been weed free in decades.

My short term memory is shit but my long term memory is great. I just don't control what i recall, it's on a when i need to know basis. but i think it was like that before i ever smoked so not sure if it's the cause.

Smoking help me avoid panic attack. i'm autistic and i have Borderline PErsonality Disorder, i'm highly socially anxious and without weed i'd need some pilss to make it through the day.

@OriginalMorningStar,"I have Synaesthesia (born with it, not drug related) and a photographic memory. Both these things mean I dont sleep well and have vivid dreams and visions while awake. Cannabis suppresses this but it has an unintended side effect... I'm a designer among other things, and I use the visions constructively - visualisations of structures, of mathematical constructs, mechanisms etc - which cannabis helps to concentrate on for longer and more fluidly. But when I sleep, that process seems to continue and I often wake with fully formed solutions to things that were on my mind before. I have no recollection of dreaming them, and it used to be a little disturbing, a bit like studying something and not remembering doing so, but having retention of the subject. Unlike normal, when I know how and where I acquired a piece of knowledge... I'm going to go out on a limb here and say its probably the Synaesthesia at the root of this, but its the cannabis enabling it through the REM interaction. I gather that 'normal' dreams are synaesthetic, in that they are full experiences, and I can relate that to my waking experiences compared to my memories. I also know that long-term heavy cannabis use can cause synaesthesia, and that getting really high can temporarily induce it. Everyone I know who smokes, reports that music becomes a more profound experience as a result, but it doesnt change mine a great deal, I've always enjoyed a permanent minds-eye light show in response to sound. It also does not affect my memory, which is unusual I gather, cannabis is known to affect short-term memory. I dont have one, everything goes straight into permanent memory. I should also point out that is a much a curse as a blessing, and cannabis helps me deal with it...
I just thought you might find it interesting to know what the stuff does to an atypical brain as a reference, because most of the effects of cannabis appear to be psychological rather than pathological, and are as a result rather hard to interpret in general. I learned this through extensive psychological testing after misdiagnosis as Aspergers / Autism and was recommended by a psychiatrist to use the stuff rather than prescription drugs with way more deleterious effects.",0,2023-10-13T10:56:24Z,0

 i think cannabis is one of the hardest things to study because it seems to effect people very differently. just because it effects me like this doesn't mean it effects everyone like this. 

 even the tolerance seems different in people,  after a weeks of smoking my tolerance is so high i dont feel any effects at all no matter how much i smoke. but i take even 3 days off and i get pretty damn high, after a week without its almost like getting high for the first time, i get blitzed so easily but i know lots of other chronic smokers and some of their tolerances work differently, some seem that they can always can get high if they smoke enough but their tolerance takes way longer to go away",1,2023-10-13T09:11:47Z,2

@BearBlair,"Im no doctor, but there is a 100% correlation with sleep and THC use, and not in a great way for restful sleep. Literally everyone I know who still smokes, and have been smoking for years (some decades), don't dream very often, can't sleep w/o THC, low overall energy, and say they get terrible sleep (and then blame it on ""i slept wrong"" instead of their 10+ yrs of using). From someone who has used more than chronic use (high all day for about 3 years straight [never really built a tol]). About 3-6 months off after finally not smoking, I defiantly have noticed a very positive change in my sleep. I can get to sleep quicker, stay asleep more, but I still don't dream really ever. And I mean literally almost never. Although that's probably due to the brain damage I caused from smoking so much. Yeah, I came out of that 3 years with psychosis, and actual brain damage. 9/12 cranial nerves in my brain are shot, and I hallucinate pretty often.. defiantly not for everyone. (Yes it's all diagnosed). I am not telling anyone to not smoke, or to smoke. Do what you please, but please do not smoke until you're brain is fully developed or else you can end up like me. Life long irreversible damage to your brain.

Side note: before I figured out I had brain damage, I did try to go back to THC. Tried this multiples times over the course of a few months, but each time I smoked, my sleep and some other very impactful things suffered DRAMATICALLY for about 2-3 weeks after just using once (1 or 2 puffs, barely really getting my toes wet thb).",0,2023-10-13T02:21:26Z,1

@markgoodwin5918,"Pretty spot on. Although I find the studies a joke. I have probably smoked an average of 3.5 grams (an eighth) daily since about 2007, so where would I fall on this ""used once in the last 20 days is chronic?"" I'm doing Sober October, and the mood swings are freaking amazing. At least this break, the wild and weird dreams are not awakening me in a full on rage. Instead, I'm flying into huge rages at the smallest irritant. Previous attempts to cut back, I had to light a joint, just to handle work, and not lose it on someone who wouldn't deserve it. Luckily, I'm able to work from home half the week, so few witness these bouts of wrath. 
I've gone from few if any dreams to incomprehensible ""what the bleep was that?"" Waking up multiple times a night. I use to handle weed just fine, but once dabs became a norm...... That tipped me from, ""I enjoy it, nothing wrong,"" to ""I have a problem, and I need to assert my own control and decisions.""

Side note, I know a lot of people experience stress/anxiety dreams which can be more vivid or intense than normal dreams. Could it be that when individuals stop consuming cannabis the anti-anxiety effect wears off causing dreams to be more vivid? (in addition to the REM deprevation effects).",0,2023-10-13T01:24:44Z,0

@danieljmarvin,"From experience, I find that weed used over a short period of time increase inner experiences but over a long period of time decreases them. Inner experiences include emotions, visualization, the ego etc. Visualization is key (in many people) for  memory and rem sleep. I'm confident in my conclusions. I'm not surprised by any of this. 

10 mg edible once a week after work is the sweet spot. Do it on a day that you relaxing the next day - not going to the gym etc. I do it Friday afternoons. It's the perfect break to where you get to consolidate your experiences throughout the week and you feel no urge to take it afterwards. I don't feel like my life is less when I'm sober. It's like I get a two week vacation every week. I've tried it all. Twice a week is too much if you want a sustainable schedule for the rest of your life. 

Of course, if friends are in town or it's a holiday it's fine to do more but only because you have a health relationship to it. Once you feel a draw to it or sobriety is somehow lacking you've gone (way) to far.",0,2023-10-12T22:25:34Z,0

@climbboy4722,"For anyone trying to quit I want to share my own experience. I smoked consistently for 3 years. I stopped because I was hospitalised after having a breakdown due to a combination of factors and using weed as a crutch to escape my feelings of loneliness. The first week of sleep was awful I was waking up between 3 to 6 times a night it was awful. I woke up drenched in sweat but I kept forcing myself back to sleep until I had reached a set time in the morning to get up. Just don‚Äôt leave the bed. After that first week I saw a very quick turnaround of being able to sleep well again. It was then a couple of months later I started having constant sleep interruption again Changing my scenery really helped with this and I have been clean and having good quality sleep since. If you are having trouble sleeping I would recommend changing your bedroom around a bit, reorganise the furniture, change the lighting if you can and make sure your bed is comfortable and change the smell by using a new washing liquid you enjoy. This increases the novelty of falling asleep because changing your sleeping environment creates a weird sensation of being somewhere new and I personally think this works because normally weed makes things seem more novel and entertaining to your brain doing this lets you cut out the chemical component while keeping some of the novelty your brain will still be craving.

*""ACT test scores fall to lowest levels in 32 years""*
_Oct 11, 2023 - Politics & Policy_

Among other things, it says:

_""The 2023 composite score, an average of the scores for the English, math, reading and science sections, was 19.5 out of 36. This was the lowest since at least 1991. ... Average scores have been declining for six consecutive years ... 42% of students failed to meet any of the ACT's subject benchmarks in English, reading, science and math, which are the minimum test scores required for students to have a reasonable chance of success in typical first-year college courses""_

@alanverduzco6513,"i was depressed while using weed before. I knew i was depressed before i started to use weed. I went on a journey to find a solution for my depression. I took magic mushrooms as my path to recover and I had amazing results. my anxiety and depression were gone. After the trip and a month had passed. My outlook on life changed drastically. I noticed a lot of bad physical and mental habits along the way. And I acted swiftly to improve myself adapting and chilling. I haven't had fun with everything life has to offer since about 14 years ago. My stride is back along with apparent weight-loss.  Through my new found purpose in therapy and philosophical studies. At a pivot point through all this, I almost went schizo for a moment while using weed if it weren't for my connection with my emotions and real peer-reviewed documentation through my research. And through this I discovered all my misdiagnosed issues. I learned so much about them and beyond and am currently working on a fascinating thesis about it. I had good anchors and saw schizophrenia face to face, sop to speak. I discovered I've had onset schizophrenia most of my childhood. Since my mushroom trip, marijuana has been a great addition in my toolset for general purposes. I use it less often since my rediscovery. But, I love it every time I use it.  It makes me so creative and helps me find solutions to problems in general applications. Not excluding my studies.
What I learned through this experience is that, for a lot of people; they ride the marijuana high with stride. Others, on the other hand; could use an improvement in their outlook on health and/or wisdom about the workings of the substance. To be, more conscious. Consciousness is a good step towards beating mental illnesses. I hope that my research on all these subjects helps a lot of people in the future!

@JSalaamMusic,"Interesting, I‚Äôve been using cannabis for about 5 months to help with my sleep and I sleep very well on it. The data you show is interesting considering and is pretty general considering I‚Äôve seen studies that say the amount of time people need for sleep decreases as they get older. I personally sleep 6 hours a day and get very restful sleep when on cannabis. 

Caveats here are that I only smoke before bed and I do VERY little recreational use of Cannabis. 

I do notice that when I am out with friends that I find less of a need for alcohol as a social lubricant when on Cannabis. I also do not feel sleepy or tired when on Cannabis when I am out with friends and I only smoke Indica and Indica forward hybrids. 

I may not be the typical case, I have noticed that instead of my normal 2-3 drags of a joint that I am now at the 4-5 drags level. I was ill for the last three days and chose not to smoke and my dreams did seem more vivid than normal. 

Speaking of dreaming, I have wild and very vivid dreams when I am on Cannabis. I also notice a strange habit to have very vivid hat I would call, pre-dreams, the moment before I fall asleep I imagine strange visual and situational creativity that do not come to mind normally. 

Anyway, you wanted my opinion so there it is. Hope that is helpful.",1,2023-10-12T18:56:18Z,0

@drakhir,"Good video - you put things clearly and succinctly. Nice one :)
One point to make about the study of students at 5.40 - it's important to be able to tell the difference between causation and correlation.
Just because people who smoke more weed  have more incidences of insomnia, does not mean it is caused by that. Most people who smoke, roll it with tobacco. So they are more likely to smoke more tobacco as well. Does the study differentiate?
Also as noted earlier, with 50% of people using marijuana to fall asleep, this may be reflected in the figures regarding how much insomnia they continue to have while using. Thus, it could be that the set of insomniacs are far more likely to smoke, thus showing the correlation, rather than the insomnia being caused by the smoking.
That's just two metrics. There are others. Unless the study differentiated between these things, then it cannot show causation; only correlation.
EDIT - okay, you mention this specifically. Nice one ;) However the conclusion you draw is less certain, due to this evidence.
The correlation are the statistics. The causation is the inference. This inference may be unwarranted.

What works for you, though - that's the best data you can use. Glad you're on top of it. My question is always ""Who is in control?"" If it's not me...

@ptorres5536,"This is so relevant to me right now.

I've been smoking hashishe regularly for the longest time, but a month ago my friend who supplied me went away so I decided to take a break until I can cultivate my own weed. Just tonight I had the craziest dream. And I've been commenting with several people that, for a long time, I had no dreams at all. And I do relate with the increased dosage for the same effect. I always had a very long sleep onset since I was a kid, and THC does put me to sleep faster, but I liked dreaming. I'm not sure about the other negatives in my personal life but I can see how it could affect other aspects of my well being. Overhall I've been more productive and have more drive to accomplish things that need doing. But I do love me a good high, which I also have not been getting since lately I was somoking so much for a fraction of the high I got when I first started smoking. 

My plan now that I've seen this video, is to prepare my setup to grow some weed for personal use but maybe limiting the consumtion to 2-4 times a month, in the weekends, which will also lower the amount of weed I need to produce. I'll be hoping not to get back to those old habits.

Just my 2 cents on the matter. Anyone else relates to this?",1,2023-10-12T15:39:18Z,0

@mervunit,"so I have medical PTSD prescription. I would wake up in the middle of the night covered in sweat from having dreams. a gummy in the evening and I can actually get a whole nights sleep. Some times I have faint recollections of dreams when I wake up but it soon is unrememberable. Most nights I remember nothing of dreaming. I don't use heavily, I purchased 14g flower 6 months ago to make gummies with and I still have about 3g flower left and almost a whole batch of 40 some gummies. (each batch makes about 50 gummies from about 1g of pressed rosin which varies from flower to flower but good flower will yield about 20-25% weight). The reduction of REM sleep is probably what allows this to help me and is much preferable than complete interrupted sleep with elevated heart rate and having to towel off in the middle of the night and try to go back to sleep on a towel for the 2-3 hours before you have to get up for work. I'd be interested to see how some of the pharma sleep aids I've used before effect sleep as well. Because those made me feel so much worse in the morning than cannabis ever has.

Even if I am moderately high these days when getting to bed, I find myself really struggling to get to sleep - with my brain (almost like TV static) just going over random thoughts far more than it would be compared to when I have not smoked. As the video says as well, I rarely dream at all if I am above a threshhold of highness and sometimes the dreams are just very delayed until I am about to wake up. I've gotta say as well, some of these nights where I have smoked later in the day will make me wake up feeling as though my brain never stopped thinking despite being asleep, instead of the much more recharged feeling in the mornings after good, dream-filled sleep. Anways, I love weed and dreams both for the insights they give, but it is certainly a juggling act for my brain specifically (everyone is wired differently, of course) to make sure I'm not smoking at the expense of that sweet REM sleep and dreams.",0,2023-10-12T15:32:57Z,2

@jkii1105,"Different strains are used for specific areas, you have 3, indica, hybrid, and sativa.

 This is more effective and way better than any pill, I've been on horse tranquilizers before, so this is way safer. 

 The problem is people don't understand the medication before they take it. Know the effects of what it does, and also the possibility of side effects which all have side effects, I've still to see weed have these same side effects. 

 Everyone has depression at some point and is irritable or even moody. Weed isn't addictive or habit forming nor can one overdose. 

 Weed can help with sleep, as it has helped with mine, also with chronic pain with my hips cause I was born breached. 

 It does not have an effect on memory, I've been using it for over 40 years and my memory isn't perfect, it didn't have anything to do with my long term or short term memory. 

 It's also great for those who have an eating disorder as I do. I just don't care for food and it does help me eat. I still only eat once a day but I do eat and don't go to just bones like someone anorexic. 

 With dreams I would say it varies with people, this is another reason I like marijuana. Ever have dreams that are so surreal, you know you were there. I have seen the end of the earth, the rapture, zombies, end of days, it's nice to get a good night sleep once in a while and cannabis helps with them. 

 Withdrawal is in the mind, it's a chemical dependency most of the time, cannabis has no known negative effects, or is known to be addictive. If you have a dependency of pills to say help control diabetes it's not a dependency. 

 Marijuana is actually a safe weed, anything can be considered a drug when it is used incorrectly. You wouldn't try to fly a car would ya?

@MMW1299,"I've been smoking every single day for the past few years. I actually always slept soooo insanely good when smoking before bed. (I usually slept between 8-9 hours with no problems at all)
Now I'm on a t-break (it's been 4 weeks by now) and all I can say is that I have troubles falling asleep because my mind is all over the place.
The positive aspect of it is that my dreams are 10x times more intense.

So I honestly don't know what to do...if I should continue my t break in hopes that I will adapt eventually and fall asleep faster or if I should be like ""screw it, falling asleep in literal minutes is better than having intense dreams and only falling asleep in like 1-2 hours""

edit: and I should also add that I had these problems falling asleep way before I started smoking pot. Which makes me even more undecisive",1,2023-10-12T14:35:42Z,0

@ravinraven6913,"yup, hopefully texas will let people use it medicinally or just legally. I remember in Alpine we would go months without finding any. So many law enforcement agencies and all. And the crime rate would go up, despite there being more law enforcement. Drug use would also go up. Just not of Cannabis, THC or CBD. 

It's the first place I went to where the state ACTIVELY tried to make it so they didn't have to help you. Took me over a year to get an ID as they didn't want me to secretly be a hurricane Katrina survivor and move there for benefits. No, I moved from Oregon for work. I need an ID to cash my check. Then I had to sign a paper saying I wouldn't ask for food stamps or anything. Which was illegal. But they will actively pay more money to get you to stay away from social services than the money they would have actively paid. Lawyer $15,000 one month of food stamps $74. So $880 for a year, compared to $15,000 EACH time they are used. 

And don't even get me started on the electric grid, it's like the state was meant for prisoners and people who aren't American citizens. Water pumps, no electricity, no water.

I'm certainly not afraid of death but not in a rush to hurry it up any more.

What kicked it off for me was high doses of Targin (endone and other stuff) wasn't working in the slightest. Hell even the hospital hate when I used to go into full muscle back spasm as even when double dosed on morphine it'd still take a dozen odd to pin me to the bed out of sheer pain and frustration. Triple or more dose later and I'd finally get something but they were worried. Since starting I've lopped off the pain tablets down to ibuprofen and panadol (soon to be just ibuprofen).

But I have been in this scenario many times and I'm just done with having bad sleep. Weed makes me less present and depressed, when I use it systematically on a daily basis. And a night with bad sleep, also makes me less present of course",0,2023-10-12T14:21:37Z,0

@EatSleepSkrrt,"Its good and bad, its literally 50/50 for people if ur like me and have adhd( or have ptsd, add, tinnitus or any other conditions even pain sometimes) it can help u fall asleep well, but there are a couple factors like( tricomb development, cbd, thc, and other canabinoids may very per strain) so if u have a type of weed that will give you a ""body stond effect"" maybe do to Amber tricombs in combination with the canabinoids (cbd,thc,hhc,ect) also there is a big factor if you smoke it or eat it, also, like this video explains it does effect most people's ram sleep, but thats not a issue for people with ptsd for example since most people with ptsd suffer trauma while in ram sleep, so it could improve quality of sleeping, but it can also help with falling asleep for people having a hard time falling asleep anyway do to adhd and just be thinking to much, or other things that might make it harder to fall asleep compared to ""regular"" people.

Also i do want to note, i like weed, but you should keep it to a minimum, i do it 24/7, but i would suggest you only do it in the evening before sleeping, not more then 1 a day, also if u suffer from ptsd, and this works for you, but i still want to quit, i would assume u might get wilder dreams, that might be a huge problem.

Also, i want to note that I'm not a expert in the matter nor am i a doctor or anything that would have to do with medical studies, i am just some dude that likes to research a lot, about things i am interested in or passionate about, so don't take this as actual advice‚ù§üòÇ",0,2023-10-12T13:23:14Z,0

Another thing it helps with is my sleep paralysis which back in the day it was at least once a week where now, along with some stress management and healthy eating, I only have it once maybe every three to four months and they don't last as long or are as horrific. My dreams are actually quite active, and I've never noticed the lack of sleep unless I've used extremely high THC %, which doesn't really work for my pain anyway. I take a 3 to 1 THC and CBD blend, which really works for me. AC DC specifically. This is all very interesting, though, and I'm thrilled we are continuing to do more research for weed and any of its cousins.

@ReiverBlue1971,"I smoke to deal with my ADHD but I also have EUPD (Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder). EUPD means you can experience emotions at an order of magnitude greater than would be considered normal (anger is rage, happiness is euphoria) and you can swing from one to the other nigh on instantly. This is normally caused by childhood trauma triggering the long term exposure of the Amygdala to Cortisol, damaging it. The Amygdala, as said, regulates emotion before being processed by the prefrontal cortex/higher brain functions, but with this damage it goes into overdrive hence the difficulties with emotion (my own issue being extreme anxiety/fear). Weed stops me feeling so much AND slows my brain down enough that ADHD becomes less of a nightmare. Many ADHD suffers have their circadian rhythm disturbed (I get tired at about 3-4am and can't get up much earlier than noon!) but weed allows me to at least get to bed earlier.....I just need to find out how to get up earlier now :P Much that I enjoy it, I'd rather I didn't HAVE to smoke as I can't deny it leaves me ""blunt"" (pardon the pun) and lazy for the rest of the next day (and it also costs a fortune!).",0,2023-10-12T12:50:48Z,0

@DreamskyDance,"In personal experience it helps me tremendously with sleep. I had breaks of not using it for long periods of time, few months at the time to few years at the time, and i never got enough sleep or rested in that times.
For me it is not so much about falling to sleep as is the quality of sleep, with marijuana i get completely rested and wake up refreshed for work after 5 or 6 hours of sleep while without it i wake up like somebody beat me up in my sleep every morning, i am sleepy at work and have to drink about half a liter of coffee before noon to even function.
Also, i am and always was very vivid dreamer...without marijuana i dream and remember dreams literally every night multiple times at night, and yes it is cool sometimes because those are experiences and sort ""trips"" the likes of which i never had even close under the influence of marijuana ( which is supposed to be a bit of psychoactive substance ), which is funny because it turns out my sober brain sleeping is the most potent recreational drug for me. But that impedes my sleep and rest significantly.
I take breaks in usage, due to circumstances most often, but the funny thing is if i would want to take a break on purpose i would have to do it while i am on work leave for holidays or something because it boosts my productivity so much by giving me solid and healthy sleep.

@Mallsus2,"I'm a quadriplegic and I use it for my shoulder pain and to help sleep, but I don't use it daily. It's usually 2 to 3 times a week at most and usually always in the evenings between 5:00 and 9:00 p.m.. as well, I vape it sometimes with a dry herb vaporizer but I would say 95% of the time it's consumed as an oil that I infuse myself. My lungs can't tolerate the smoke of burning it.

I think because of the residual pain relief the next day I usually wake up feeling very rested and with my body not bothering me as much less making my day better.

I also Don't generally sleep more than six -ish hours a night and that goes back to way before I started consuming the devil's lettuce. Most nights I have to force myself to stay awake till at least 11:00 to 12:00. So I don't wake up at 2 or 3:00 a.m. and even then I still wake up before 6:00 almost every day and when I sleep in it's generally no more than 8:00 in the morning when I naturally wake up.",0,2023-10-12T08:20:08Z,0

@andyb1653,"Don't smoke sativa strains before going to bed. If you simply MUST smoke before trying to sleep, go with an indica-type.

It's easy to remember: ""Indica"" sounds like ""In de couch"". Like sleeping on the couch. Also, don't mix pot with other sleep aids. Taking melatonin with pot is a good way to f*ck up your circadean rhythm. It's one or the other. The combo might SEEM to work at first, but you're confusing the shit out of your body by doing so.

@bluegender2005,"I have also started to be a regular consumer when the pandemic started - at first with bigger pauses and then more and more frequently. I only consumed in the evening before going to sleep and also small quantities - quarter till a half of a tobacco mixed joint. It became my late evening ritual because it put me to sleep and gave me the comfortable feeling, that everything is alright.

Not only my dreams have stoped, but the process of waking up in the morning became more and more tedious, requiring a very long time to find the motivation to start with my daily tasks - most of the time i work as a freelancer in the creative sector.

A few weeks after my dreams have stoped something strange started to happen: I started waking up almost at the exact same time every night - 2 till 3 hours after going to sleep and feeling wide awake, needing extra time to sleep again. Luckily I knew that if I went for another hit to fall back asleep will lead to a less than optimal habit.

After the prolonged consume, I used to make 3 to 4 days tolerance breaks and notice that I was always moody, very irritated and sensitive. My memory and concentration dropped significantly. I could function again only when I restarted the daily evening ritual.

The whole take from this should be, that because of the legalising, decriminalisation and widespread societal acceptance, we have became blind to the risk potential of the frequent recreational use of weed. Moderation is the key, and I feel we need more videos like this one, pointing to the adverse effects, rather than the beneficial ones.",0,2023-10-12T07:50:07Z,0

@Welgeldiguniekalias,"I've been a very heavy user who smoked high THC weed daily for decades with very few breaks.

Recently, I went to smoking only once a week, and found that I was able to sleep for 6-8 hours, but would wake up once in the middle of the night pretty much every night. It definitely shuts up my amygdala and helps to cool me down, but all in all I would say weed has been disruptive to my sleep. I guess I'm quitting regular use now, since it's been over a week and I don't really feel the urge at the moment.

@loganskiwyse7823,"Good research here.  Overall, a very accurate representation of where the current science is.

I would say my only complaint is far too many of these studies on both sides are based on anecdotal evidence.  Aka studies where you ask about user's experiences compared to studies done in labs.  While this is in large part due to the still difficult nature of doing real medical studies with marijuana legally it also makes the error factor of the studies, we do have far too high to draw conclusions.

The second part of why this is an issue is a huge number of regular users also have mild to moderate mental health disorders.  Autism, ADHD, and many other disorders have a high undiagnosed but self-medicating population.  Even within the diagnosed communities use is higher than outside those communities.  (Reminder I am talking frequent use compared to occasional recreational use).

I suffer from PTSD, insomnia, depression and anxiety (Yay repeated traumatic experiences growing up and being a first responder!) so I used THC for sleep. I went from 2-4 hours a night to 4-6 hours and even longer when I first started using last year. I have noticed I don't dream (which is nice, my dreams were not good ones) but I do feel okay. I took a 5 day break and the first day I was awake for 24 hours and had 2 hours of sleep. The next day was closer to 22 hours awake and like 2 or 3 hours of sleep. I was a heavy user. Very heavy. So I think I might try cutting down and seeing what happens. I am actually going to shower and smoke right now lol. Thanks for this awesome vid.

@MrStumpson,"This video is 100% accurate to my experience, and why I believe I will never use Marijuana again. When using it would effect me well into the day and heavily impacted my memory and cognitive ability, leading me to be able to function after 12 hours since my last toke, but still have memory issues and still be slow and almost feel still intoxicated and dumb because of it. Then I finally quit smoking due to how much the effects would continue to linger, and I've never been able to sleep the same way as I did before I was a regular user. I have struggled with insomnia even weeks after quitting. I've quit before when I was a less regular user, and only struggled with insomnia for like the first week after quitting. Now it's harder than ever, and I'm concerned I'll never sleep like a baby as I once did before using ever again. All I have to think about is how long it would linger and effect me cognitively, even 16 hours after my last toke, and now how it has effected my sleep long term, and I don't think I'll ever go back to it.",8,2023-10-12T05:25:49Z,5

@HonoredMule,"Not a good start when the first 15 seconds opens with an utterly bullshit statistic.  So I checked.  Technically, it _is false,_ but not so far off as I'd have thought.

Starbucks: 1,429
Taco Bell: 103
Burger King: 359
Wendy's: 418
McDonald's: 1,370

restaurants total: 3,679
cannabis dispensaries: 3,188

Yikes, that's closer than I'd have ever believed.  The more surprising part is how rare Taco Bell is though.  Also...

Tim Hortons: 3,528

Edge out past _that_ number and you'll have a proper sensationalist headline.

Either way, the video opens with an exaggeration (lie), so consider the rest accordingly.  I'm also disappointed that of the 7 sources cited, only _one_ operated on a sufficient sample size but even that one is a very select demographic (university students, so mostly young adults) and the publicly available text truncates every section to uselessness.  The rest average about 60 participants but do at least publish usable abstracts.

I'm predisposed to agree with this video's overall perspective and yet it still looks more to me like an exercise in confirming bias (finding what you sought) than an open-minded analysis.  How much effort went into seeking contradictions and avoiding contextual abuse?  Yes research data is as yet scarce, but it's still up to you _not_ to simplify barely-valid highly-nuanced complexity down to a picture clearly pointing in only one direction.  Enabling people to run around thinking they understand something with which they're barely even acquainted is done easily enough _without_ a science communicator.",0,2023-10-12T05:10:40Z,0

@sapphfire24,"I would be interested to know if these studies were done just on smokers. I have been taking medically prescribed, highly controlled medicinal cannabis tinctures for years. I need a very small dose of THC to get to sleep (most would consider it a microdose) and I have never built up a tolerance. I sleep and remember dreams almost every morning. I take it for chronic pain, as pain was waking me up every hour (I would get up to stretch, walk around etc. and felt shocking in the morning). Cannabis gives me a solid 7 hours before wearing off and pain wakes me. I have multiple chronic illnesses but cannabis has allowed me to at least sleep, and wake up feeling half decent. I am sure dose and type makes a big difference, along with people's tolerances and personal biochemistry. I am THC sensitive, so after 7 years of taking it, I am still responding to a small dose. I take ""breaks"" now and then to check to see if it is still doing its job, and I can report no issues falling asleep, but pain wakes me again and again, so I always return to it.

Herbal teas, colored lights, exercising a little over an hour before bed, melatonin, sleeping pills, etc. The lifestyle changes made no noticable difference, the melatonin didnt work, and sleeping pills were not really designed for daily use.
Marijuana was literally life changing for me. I fall asleep HOURS faster, I do actually dream more, and I wake up less often in the middle of the night. I recently converted from gummies with 1mg of THC to pure CBD & while I have noticer it is ever-so slightly less effective, I still have a higher quality of life thanks to this drug.
I highly recommend keeping your tolerance levels low, regardless of whether you're using CBD, THC, or both. I have never consumed more than 20mg of CBD or 5mg of THC for sleep and I am currently trying to lower my THC tolerance back down to 10mg doses. Part of the reason for these side effects are probably due to large dosages.

I really limit the use. 1 good pull off a bowl before bed, only on nights before I need to get up and be functional at a set time in the morning. It's worked a charm for me, I haven't had any need to up the dosage for the same effect, or really noticed any change in dreaming. It's worked better than anything else I've tried.

Decided to quit last year and it's been the best yet toughest decision of my life. The first 2 weeks were an absolute nightmare, but I believe going cold turkey with marijuana is the only way to go if you're trying to quit. I have 0 regrets, I'm so glad I let go of it. Almost over a dozen aspects of my life have gotten better in ways I can't even describe. Biggest impact of all was my sleep, I can't believe I was choosing to miss out on such a good night's sleep for 7 whole years. Take the leap and just go for it, out of the blue.

@youwokeuplate,"I have been an insomniac as long as I can consciously remember. I began relying on weed to sleep and it seemed like a life saver. I used nightly probably 3 years, until I saw a video about how weed reduces ur ability to dream (which I experienced) which inhibits your subconscious ability to process emotions. This alarmed me, and I also felt like weed just wasn‚Äôt putting me out like it used to, and I found myself staying awake and needing more doses.

So, I switched to only CBD capsules and then in a matter of time, ended up replacing both with transcendental meditation.. which I didn‚Äôt anticipate using as a sleep aide. 

I am an artist w an overactive mind and wanted to try TM morning and night simply to help calm my mind and help my creative intuition/process. And from day one, it ended up putting me to sleep that night, maybe even quicker than THC ever did.

I learned meditation with a therapist for a year before this then but never found a meditation I could rely on to work to clear my anxious mind this quickly. TM does it for me. I am amazed I have slept every night without weed, without worrying, without hours of spiraling thoughts. I wake up feeling so proud of myself.

Note I also incorporated less screen time overall pretty much eliminating all social media (which greatly reduced my overactive mind) and replaced that habit with journaling. Stream of conscious journal before my nightly TM is hugely beneficial. I am so grateful to have found a technique I can rely on that isn‚Äôt substance. I know a lot of our life circumstance that cause stress is out of control. But u need to reduce stress where u can help it and overconsumption of media is a big stressor a lot of us would rather overlook bc we like the facade of connection and the mind numbing it brings.

From the time I was 18 to 28, I would take a break for one or two days each month, and boy were those some of the wildest/vivid dreams I ever had. At age 28 I decided to quit cold turkey, and boy was that a nightmare. For about 3 months, I probably only slept 2-3 days. There were multiple days in those 3 months where I did not get sleep AT ALL; I'm talking that deep, REM sleep, I got none as I felt awake the whole night;  I had to call in sick for 2 weeks at work and I felt EXTREMELY depressed. Withdrawal symptoms were a surprise to me since I could take 1 or 2 days off in my younger days without any ill effects. I wish I knew about withdrawal symtomps beforehand.

@JBreaz,"Don't know if this will be seen but I've been using for years. Like a decade plus. Here are the things I noticed compared to my friends who have been using for just the same amount of time.

The sleep thing seems to be on track. Sorry to say. I have had a good ritual of smoking before bed and I do notice that in the long run  more often than not I'm staying up with my high. I usually don't get tired from it. 

My friends on the other hand are almost guaranteed to fall asleep within 20 mins. 

I've noticed that my sleep has been more or less the same with or without weed.
In 2020 on the onset of the pandemic I stopped smoking entirely. I didn't wanna chance smoking with a lung based disease going around. (Yes I know 10 years of smoke inhalation has definitely done damage, chill).

During the time that I stopped and we were in lockdown I generally became much healthier. I never really missed smoking, never really missed being high. Worked out a bunch and got great sleep. I was unprovoked. Started having dreams again. It was fine but I didn't feel any different. Honestly.

I just started back up again and I have to say it's kind of ""eh"". Like, I was never one to use it as an escape. I always valued it for the introspection it offered me and the ""zeroed in"" vibe i got when making music or any art. To me it was a tool.

Here's the interesting part: 

The older I got the more I saw a shift from it being a useful tool to becoming something that kind of was a detriment. It became a source of anxiety. Especially during my Masters. I passed out many times and had doom-level panic attacks when high. That incredible pull of doom down to the ground. Not good. Lol. 

One of my friends, who definitely leans on it as a crutch, has had the opposite experience. He seemingly counts on it to alleviate his anxiety and get to sleep. Whereas when we were younger he had panic attacks more often.

I think this has a lot to do with age and general stress, which I think is something that should be researched too.

Now I'm lucky if I smoke once a week if that. Tbh I went so long without it I kinda don't care for it anymore.

Hope this anecdotal evidence was interesting.",0,2023-10-12T02:30:12Z,0
@LluviaGloom,"I work in the Mj industry and am surrounded by a culture that romanticizes getting a higher tolerance e.g. (heady glass scene, gram dabs, constantly getting high) but because tasting hash rosin is basically our job and while I do love what I do I've noticed that getting high is no longer enjoyable because it can feel like I'm underwater and my feelings of anxiety and paranoia are dramatically increased with symptoms of my heart racing, auditory hallucinations, and strong headaches. I've been smoking nonstop for 7 years and within the last 2 years I've cut down on smoking/ vaping/ eating edibles because of this. it's so strange how as you age your high also changes. sometimes I force myself to smoke because of how much I love the taste and smell of these new genetics but usually end up giving myself a full-on panic attack.

After week 3-4, everything started to progress somewhat rapidly, I started to have a lot of vivid but unusual dreams, which was quite refreshing from not having any before I stopped.
I've started to gain more energy than I did before I stopped, but I will admit I sometimes crave it, more so when my back pain(scoliosis) starts acting up or under stressful situations.

i started tapering off and as of around february or march of this year, pretty much stopped entirely. it still takes me longer than i'd like to actually fall asleep, but i'm not staying awake all night anymore and i've been having dreams again. i smoked for the first time in months last weekend and my tolerance dropped down again too, so i can actually enjoy it.

@GodzillasWrath95,I suffer from insomnia. But I noticed after I built a tolerance to THC I ended up not being able to sleep at night at all. My sleep cycle flipped to where I would go to bed at 9am and wake up 9pm. And shortly after it would go from 9am to 11am. I have stopped smoking and I have actually regained control of my sleeping I'm usually out by 2am now and waking up around 11:30am so it's definitely helped me since I've stopped..but unfortunately when I smoke now it makes me severely nauseous. And Sometimes makes me really sick. This was happening when I was becoming tolerant but even after from not smoking for a month going back to it last Saturday it made me sick. I personally feel like something is wrong with me but I am just curious if anyone else has had this happen to them too. But it definitely has helped my sleeping and I do feel more rested lately.,0,2023-10-12T00:10:02Z,0

@myfairjew,"I've been using cannabis everyday for the past 15 years (my entire adult life), so take what I say with a grain of salt because I have very little idea of what it is like to abstain for an extended period of time. I don't have any issues with insomnia, and I am a natural heavy sleeper (based on what I remember from childhood/adolescence). In terms of sleep, what I experience is almost like a temporary hangover. It takes me almost an hour to get out of bed in the morning (hittin' that snooze over and over again baby), which is attributable to the fact that I am likely being woken up in the middle of a sleep cycle. Keep in mind that this is a daily routine. I'm always up at this time of the day, but its always hard for me to get out of bed. But, once I'm up, I feel well rested throughout the day. I think the way weed affects sleep will vary quite a bit from person to person, and even the same change in the sleep cycle will affect people differently. I've also been known to sleep through my alarm if I go to bed too late (only if I'm to be up before my normal time), which is not good for employment longevity.",0,2023-10-11T23:41:15Z,0

@kkaixer,"Well, where i use it it is illegal.
I have sum sleeping issues since im 4. And no, i dont have any traumas from that age. It just started at that age. So, i am having trouble falling asleep, and if i by any chance fall asleep, i usually cant go to deep sleep and if i feel uncomfortable during my sleep, i automatically wake up, change position and try to sleep again which takes another hour or so. This influenced my learning ability, daily life quality and many other things inclusive memory.

Since i started to use weed at least the first two years, i was able to sleep good. But with time i started to  develop the anxiety that i wont be able to sleep without weed, which as you said caused me to use higher doses with time. 
Now, good sides back then was good sleep, a very active mind which  helped me with work and develop new ideas but it made me extremely weak in memory. Well, bcz of sleeping issues my memory was already weak but while giving a broader view on my thoughts weed also took the sharpness away.

The other side effect is that, it really makes you lazy and careless. Which is not so preferable. 

Another problem is that, it opens your system to alergies. Yesh, using too much weed causes cotton mouth but if your eyelids feel scratchy all the time, it means you have too much thc in your body, which you should get rid off asap. 
The mucosal secretion is restricted because weed affects the processing of water in the body. Nasal dryness, means more germ into your body more allergens etc.


But i also have exprienced that if you can stop using weed for at least two days, you stop desiring it. Difficult two days...

But i wanted to see how far i can go so i stopped vaping it for at least 4 months. 

This helped me to get rid off even those weird mood swings. And i felt really clear. And the sharpness came back.

Btw i definetly recommend to take vitamin B, which helps you in so many ways, espcially in this case. 

After that i have found the best ratio for me of daily use, which is 0.25 grams. 

I vape it around 20:00 after dinner(less to none munchies). I experience a very quality high. I dont get the side effects like dryness in my nose and so on.

And when its effects wears off, i feel a sweet sleepy mood.

Now there are some No-Go's.
1. Don't vape it in the morning or during the day. It will have bad influence.
2. Experience your high till the end and never go to sleep while you are high.
3. Do not combine it with any other drugs, inclusive coffee.
4. Any sativa higher than 70% can cause panic, confusion, paranoia.
5. Any indica higher than 70% can cause depression, isolation, melancholia",0,2023-10-11T23:29:32Z,0

@itsanapesworld,"So: Ive been a daily user for aprox 14 years, Ive fallen into a depression in the last few years and this week finally decided to quit daily usage, especially since no matter how much i smoke, i dont feel any effect anymore, it works on me kinda like an antidepressant, stabilizing my mood, but not allowing for ""highs"" in my mood, and still having ""downs"". In the last few nights since quitting (notice im still smoking CBD to alleviate the withdrawal symptoms) I indeed have more, as well as much more vivid dreams, but Ive also noticed, that my sleep paralysis (that I had almost every night when I was a teenager before consuming thc) is back - yesterday Ive waited for about 3 hours to fall asleep because of that, and now i wonder if thc could have a positive effect on sleep paralysis in particular. Is there any research about this? Anyways Cannabis is still a drug even if its in my view one of the less harmful ones. Dont take regular use to lightly since the psyche gets very dependant on it. Also ive noticed that I'm much more talkative since quitting and I cried the first time in years (not a depressive crying but tears of joy), I even feel my body much more and feel more connected to people and my surroundings. So do not ever take it to ""hide"" who you truly are because that was the reason Ive fallen into deep addiction from it! Be careful and accept yourself for what you are - no point in trying to hide it by dampening yourself to a ""zombie"" like state!

@SuperHonkyPodcast,"I've been on a multiple year bender of smoking weed every single day and recently decided to quit for financial reasons.
Because of this, my sleep this last week has been absolutely terrible!  I've been averaging only 2 hours of sleep a night
no matter HOW TIRED I feel when I lay down in bed.   Not only that.. I roll around in bed for a good hour after I wake up
just HOPING that I'll fall back asleep.. but I never do.  This leads me to hopping out of bed in an absolutely terrible mood!
The good news is.  I've had the same issue in the half dozen other times I've stopped smoking weed throughout the years
and it typically gets resolved within 10-14 days of quitting.  Here I sit.. day #6 of not smoking weed, and I feel like a HOT
mess!  I've been raging, depressed, feeling down and out, no energy, and have even had plenty of suicidal thoughts in just
this last week since walking away from marijuana.  It's ironic that this video pops up in my feed as I'm smack dab in the
middle of the insomnia faze.  The thing that sucks even more is, typically I used to only smoke flower.  And flower is not
as potent as THC cartridges that we smoke with vape pens.  So typically about in about a week my sleep would improve
significantly.  However.. these last two years I've stepped completely away from flower and have only been vaping the
THC cartridges you can buy.  So this time around it feels even HARDER on me.  It used to be that if I stopped smoking
flower, the only thing that would really SUCK is the lack of sleep for about a week.  This time around however, not only
am I suffering from insomnia, but I've been dealing with higher anxiety than normal, crazy amounts of rage, and even
thoughts of suicide.  Every morning that I'm forced to get out of bed I can't help but think about the pistol that's under
my bed and even went as far as telling my Wife to hide the pistol from me out of sight out of mind.  I don't exactly think
I'd ever be the type to commit suicide, but even the thoughts of that being an option is absolutely terrifying.

Smoking it to me is crude tho, if that makes sense .

Having tolerance allows one to function while medicated. And of course, it depends on the individual organism.

I'm not sure if I stop permanently if I'll be able to dream as normal or if I'm simply dreaming as an effect of stopping smoking. Video also says that it makes you have poor sleep, well 15+ years of mostly daily use with some breaks in between of varying lengths, I am more rested than most but the key is I actually sleep the recommended amount of hours, or around that ball park of 8 hours. 7 - 8 hours is what I usually get in. But usually one day a week I sleep in like 10 - 12 hours as well, and I've basically always done it all my life.

I had also just hooked up with a cute girl who didn't smoke, so it seemed like the perfect opportunity to start a new chapter of my life. The first month was pretty rough with body temperature irregularity and headaches. I was confused about this at first, but then I realized that it was just withdrawal symptoms. My body chemistry eventually normalized, I wasn't overheating at night and dopamine began to be produced naturally. The dreams though, they were intense. The most vivid and wild dreams I've ever had. They were so intense that they would wake me up and I wouldn't be able to get back to sleep for fear of returning to the circus or simply because my heart was racing. It's been a couple years since I quit and the dreams are still vivid but nowhere near as intense. Sometimes, my dreams are odd and nonsensical, other times they can be mundane, but they're always full of details.

@YerpDerp17,"I am now in my mid 30's and as someone who wasn't a stranger to drugs in my early 20's, I have realized a lot.  I currently only use Marijuana.  I don't drink or consume nicotine.  But I get WAY more benefits from Marijuana by simply microdosing.  I take a hit or two in the evening, and its enough to calm my brain down, but I am not fried.  It keeps my tolerance in check, I spend way less money and I just overall feel better.  I will always believe Marijuana has its benefits, but its all dependent on the user and how they use it.  I still have my nights where I may have some friends over, or my wife and I are kiddless for the night, so we will do a little more, just to unwind and have fun.  But it is not something we do often.  And though we still use it daily, we used to use more in a day than we do in 2 weeks now. lol Weed is so strong now, that 1 or 2 hits does more than enough.  I feel like more than that is overkill, especially if used that way daily. But I think its the same for most substances.  Most of the benefits exist in the lower doses, and you start to see the negatives of use when you consume larger amounts.  Especially frequently.

@H4v3u5uff3r3d,Thanks for the video! I was smoking almost daily for 10 years and it was so difficult for me to give it up even though it had so much side effects for me... I think it made me stupid or I didn't want to address the issues I had with it but looking back now it became so obvious to me. I'm really happy I could stop smoking and a few weeks ago was the first time I woke up refreshed... The feeling was incredible because I always lacked energy and the exhaustion made me worry about myself so much but now I have so much more energy and brain power throughout the day :) I reached the rebound phase I can finally dream again and im about to get better and better.

I will say though once you get past the initial stages of withdrawals you feel so much better and more energetic. The most important thing is replacing the time you would use to smoke with something productive, like exercise or meditation.

And like the guy in the video said if you do smoke after a long break and you only have one the odd time you do sleep good especially if you've not been sleeping but that can be a slippery slope to getting back.

@HumanOddity69,"It really comes down to if the time is right to start dreaming again. There are negative effects to not dreaming but the tradeoff for someone like me is that my unmedicated dreamscape can be more powerful and real than a standard dose of a psychedelic and when a dream like that becomes a nightmare it is one of the worst mental experiences that I can describe so shutting it off is sometimes a survival tactic. That said, dreams have a powerful ability to introduce change to your life, cause you to look at things that you may not be aware of and solve problems. In other words, if you are stuck in life then you need them but if you are not then you kind of don't. I would strongly recommend at least a 1 month break every year for any smoker because you can get lost in being stuck, fail to recognize that a dream can unstick you and then look to cannabis to solve a problem that it causes. It's good to take a step back and make for sure that you are never doing this because it is a trap.",2,2023-10-11T18:35:45Z,1

@juanpabloprieto4929,"This seems pretty incomplete as an evaluation of THC on sleep, though. One of the most important factors is to see whether this REM sleep impact depends on dose and timing of THC, we know coffee to negatively affect sleep if consumed late and within not enough half lifes; saying drinking coffee overall is bad for sleep is poor science, as much as saying THC mere consumption would impact sleep without understanding the concentration curves and sleep timing. 

However, simply the systemic concentration of THC or its metabolites could long term be what has an impact. The data is particularly difficult to get a correlation from as from those students we can correlate THC consumption to insomnia, but we can not see if they used it in an appropiate time (theoretical) time window.",1,2023-10-11T18:27:24Z,0

@fatuousinnovatorofsadness4640,"It's not a trade off of problems!  It's actually a problem you ALREADY had, but never noticed.  

Basically humans have like a certain bandwidth of expression.  You know, if everything was firing off at once, it'd be hectic.  So our brain can only keep track of or hand out energy/thought space to a certain amount of things.  And if you're REALLY bogged down by something, then that leads to other lesser things getting pretty much shut off.  A good physical example of this is that you won't even notice your anger creep in when you're hungry, because the hunger is all you can feel.  

So for anxiety, you were being assaulted by that anxiety and it ended up making you do a thousand little inefficient ""what if"" thought processes, which led you to be concerned and swept up.  Your life was lived in the battleground between your anxiety and the world around you.  But... then you got some help with weed.  It absolved your anxiety, maybe because you had a realization after smoking that helped you out, or maybe because it taught you how to calm your nervous system down.  

Your anxiety was ultimately reduced because, well, it's not the anxious thoughts which cause the anxiety.  It's the system being anxious that causes the thoughts - and weed relaxes anxious systems usually.  

Now, you face a problem that weed can't fix.  Negative emotions in relation to society.  This was a part of you just like your anxiety was, it has been for probably just as long.  But something in your past hit you in a way that made a little indent in your brain.  And now those negative emotions come from that.  But they only come from that because it's activated within your brain.  Before, the anxiety took it all up.  This new thing is just like the anger.  Your anxiety(hunger) took up all the space, and you never noticed that bad relationships(anger) with the world were formed.  

You can use the weed to help you on your search, sometimes it can open you up to things you wouldn't know without it, or you can go sober and start truly exploring, diving in, and learning the language of YOU, learning the landscape of you, learning your faults and your bumps and your scary dark corners and the parts of you that you hadn't even known were so beautiful until you actually looked at yourself.  

Straight up, just get to work becoming a more beautiful person.  Whether or not weed is involved, it's truly the best journey a human can go on.",10,2023-10-12T02:30:16Z,

@fatuousinnovatorofsadness4640,"@@1stHalf I used weed myself because it was the only thing that would help me associate.  After that, though, I went a long time without.  I was totally ""fine"" - no anxiety, no issues at all really - but still not where I wanted to be, blocked in some way from getting there at all.  I would smoke, though, and the anxiety (or whatever was hurting me) would come up, and I would be able to examine it and deal with it on my terms.  I would get a bad thought and instead of saying ""the weed did this"" I would realize, no, my own brain made this happen, the weed just stirred it up for me to see.  

And with that I specifically smoked to make myself uncomfortable, and to use that state to understand what was wrong within myself that made me react that way to weed.  I ended up fixing almost all of my really hard to pin down problems because I was basically constantly exposing myself to their various external expressions and literally pinpointing exactly where they were coming from while sober, just a constant dance of finding out what's wrong and fixing it.

We both have adhd so get addicted to things very easily.

It certainly isn't me, and I'm pretty sure it's not the video author either.

There's a good chance it's no one since we simply don't have adequate research on long-term cannabis physiological effects.  We can identify that 30 days seems to be about enough to completely remove non-permanent THC _tolerance,_ but we know next to nothing as far as I can tell about how that correlates to any other physiological effects.

Since january, ive quit smoking thc and it has had a huge influence on me. I am three times as productive as before, get way better sleep than before, am way more energised during the day, like to spend more time with people, am less irritable, more talkative and overall just way happier than before. Because i struggle with the addicition i still have to the 'ritual' of smoking in the evening, i turned to cbd weed (<0.02% thc) as an alternative. from this, i dont have any of the negative side effects i had from regular weed, and its way cheaper too :).

That‚Äôs the challenge (if you‚Äôre not feeling adverse effects i.e., sleep/eating/mood etc.). 

I enjoy it so tend to slip back into daily use vs once a week; but def notice it effects my ability to sleep long periods or recall dreams the same as when I‚Äôm not using regularly.

@reXdownhamOG,I use cannabis for sleep and pain relief. I am a lucid dreamer and spend 90 minutes sleeping before I need to change the ice pads behind my neck and back. This is frustrating but I do manage to fly quite a bit while lucid dreaming.,0,2023-10-11T16:12:54Z,0
